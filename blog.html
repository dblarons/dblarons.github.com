            Jimmy Page has been my favorite guitarist ever since I first saw <i>It Might Get
            Loud</i>.  Since then I've listened to hundreds or thousands of hours of Led Zeppelin
            albums and they still never get old.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Page doesn't just make playing guitar look easy - he makes it look downright sloppy.
            Here's my favorite clip from the movie:
          </div>
          <iframe width="100%" style="margin-top:10px; aspect-ratio:16/9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gDsbOraiqg?si=TGswLHJxoxODzEo5" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <div class="section-body">
            He's not just playing guitar, he's playing time itself!
            <div class="pb"></div>
            When I first saw this clip in high school, I was playing an Epiphone Les Paul; the same
            design, albeit considerably cheaper, that Page plays in the clip. I upgraded to an
            American Telecaster a few years later and have played the same guitar ever since.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            The Telecaster is almost the perfect guitar. Page, most closely associated with his
            "Number 1" Les Paul today, actually played a Telecaster on the first Led Zeppelin album.
            (Led Zeppelin was recorded in about 30 hours of studio time - start to finish, including
            mixing - over the course of only 3 weeks. What a band.)
            <div class="pb"></div>
            My philosophy when playing guitar is to never achieve with a pedal what I can do with
            nature. In the video, Page overdrives his amp not with a pedal, but by switching from
            his neck pickup (set to a lower volume) to his bridge pickup (set to a higher volume).
            What results is the basic physical reality of his guitar's voltage swinging too high for
            the amp and getting clipped... overdrive.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            You can't play <i>Ramble On</i> the way Page does in this clip with a standard
            Telecaster. A Telecaster has a three way switch, a volume knob, and a tone knob. While
            you can switch between the neck and bridge, you can't set them to two different volumes.
            There's only one volume knob controlling both pickups. Fender addresses this with their
            dual volume Telecaster Deluxe, but in the process sacrifices the most important thing of
            all - the iconic Telecaster look.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            After years of being bothered by this and seeing no reason (or room in our Brooklyn
            apartment) to buy a Les Paul Standard, I ordered a soldering iron and resolved to crack
            open my beloved guitar.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            After careful consideration, I decided on the following modifications:
            <div class="pb"></div>
            1. Two volume knobs, so you can quickly and naturally overdrive the guitar.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            2. A Les Paul three way switch because it is in every way superior to the Telecaster's.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            3. No tone knob, cause who uses it anyways?
            <div class="pb"></div>
            4. A two way series/parallel switch.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            The first two points are obvious given what I described above. The latter two were forced
            on me by space constraints, but necessity being the mother of invention, I dare say I've
            perfected the Telecaster.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            The last dial on a standard Telecaster, the tone knob, is pretty useless. I'd argue the
            only time it <i>is</i> used is to show off, which really just makes my point. Replacing
            it with a second volume knob is a common modification.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            But the tone knob, however flawed, does represent an ideal: it's nice to have options!
            Even if those options are (if we're being honest) "spin it to one end" and "spin it to
            the other end".
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Since most players' tone knob experience is practically binary, I decided to both
            approximate and improve on that real world reality with a two way series/parallel
            switch.  I'll skip what that means in detail, but imagine it as a switch between "more
            signal" and "a little less signal".
            <div class="pb"></div>
            When I set out to make this change, I figured someone must have already done this. And
            perhaps they have... but not on the internet. I could not find a single wiring diagram
            online.  With no soldering experience and having never modified a guitar before in my
            life, I drew my own diagram and learned how to solder.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            The result is the perfect Telecaster. In parallel, the guitar plays and sounds like you
            just got it from the factory. It still looks like a Telecaster, yet the switch offers a
            Les Paul's dynamic flexibility. And in series, there's even more drive.  Sweet
            perfection.

            One of my favorite stops on our trip was Ephesus. Located in western Turkey, straight
            across the Aegean Sea from Greece and to the south of ancient Troy, Ephesus was a major
            port city and one of the richest in Asia. It was also firmly in the grip of the Roman
            Empire.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            In 55 AD, there was a disturbance in Ephesus that was recorded for us, quite vividly, in
            history. The roots of this disturbance began in 53 AD when a Jewish man, born further
            east in southern Turkey, arrived in the bustling port city.

          <div class="section-body-quote">
            He entered the synagogue and for three months spoke out boldly, and argued persuasively
            about the kingdom of God. When some stubbornly refused to believe and spoke evil of the
            Way before the congregation, he left them, taking the disciples with him, and argued
            daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.
            <br/>
            <div style="height:5px;"></div>
            This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia, both Jews and Greeks,

            Both the lecture hall of Tyrannus and the synagogue are lost to us today, but there is
            some indication that the lecture hall was replaced by the Library of Celsus (pictured
            left below, and also at the tail end of the street in the first picture) when it was
            built in the 110s AD. We found a Menorah (pictured right) carved into the stone steps of
            the Library of Celsus, a reminder of just how diverse, yet recognizable, this
            magnificent city was two thousand years ago.

            After a few years in Ephesus, Paul decides to hit the road again and keep making his way
            toward Rome:
          </div>
          <div class="section-body-quote">
            Now after these things had been accomplished, Paul resolved in the Spirit to go through
            Macedonia and Achaia, and then to go on to Jerusalem. He said, “After I have gone there,
            I must also see Rome.” So he sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia,
            while he himself stayed for some time longer in Asia.

            Acts 19:21-22
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Despite Roman era Jews and early Christians (who, like Paul, were mostly Jewish at the
            time) featuring in the story so far, Ephesus was not a Christian town. Far from it.  In
            fact, the Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, had been
            funded by the Ephesians themselves after an arsenist burned down an earlier version in
            356 BC.
          </div>
          <div class="section-body-quote">
            I have set eyes on the wall of lofty Babylon on which is a road for chariots, and the
            statue of Zeus by the Alpheus, and the hanging gardens, and the colossus of the Sun, and
            the huge labour of the high pyramids, and the vast tomb of Mausolus; but when I saw the
            house of Artemis that mounted to the clouds, those other marvels lost their brilliancy,
            and I said, "Lo, apart from Olympus, the Sun never looked on aught so grand".
            <div style="height:5px;"></div>
            Antipater, Greek Anthology IX.58
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            The Temple was a huge deal. The site of worship for people going back centuries, it was
            also an economic engine for the city. Priests, prostitutes, artisans, and farmers would
            all do regular business at and be closely interlinked with the temple's success.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Out of the wide variety of citizens in Ephesus, there was one group that refused to
            enter into in the temple's orbit. Jews, believing that their God was the one true God,
            and the only one deserving worship, were the exception to the rule. But given that they
            were a minority, with a religion so ancient as to deserve some level of mystical
            respect, the locals gave them a pass.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            So it must have been a shock when, in just a few years, a small community of Ephesians,
            not clearly defined by one race or religion (indeed, they would later be deemed
            "athiests" by the Roman authorities), stopped engaging with the temple. Our story picks
            back up around 55 AD:
          </div>
          <div class="section-body-quote">
            About that time no little disturbance broke out concerning the Way. A man named
            Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business
            to the artisans. These he gathered together, with the workers of the same trade, and
            said, “Men, you know that we get our wealth from this business. You also see and hear
            that not only in Ephesus but in almost the whole of Asia this Paul has persuaded and
            drawn away a considerable number of people by saying that gods made with hands are not
            gods. And there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but
            also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be scorned, and she will be
            deprived of her majesty that brought all Asia and the world to worship her.”
            <div style="height:5px;"></div>
            When they heard this, they were enraged and shouted, “Great is Artemis of the
            Ephesians!” The city was filled with the confusion; and people rushed together to the
            theater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were Paul's travel
            companions.
            <div style="height:5px;"></div>
            Acts 19:23-29

          <div class="section-body">
            The Ephesian theater, only a short walk past the Library of Celsus, is pictured left
            below.  It's easy to imagine the crowd, spurred on by wealthy artisans fearing their
            livelihoods, rushing in from the bustling city outside to bring these two troublemakers
            to justice.

            On the right is a statue of Artemis from the Ephesus museum.  The temple itself would
            have contained a similar one carved from wood, painted, and adorned with jewelry. This
            model and numerous other variations - big and small, for official and personal use -
            were crafted with great skill by artisans like Demetrius and his colleagues.

            Meanwhile, some were shouting one thing, some another; for the assembly was in
            confusion, and most of them did not know why they had come together. Some of the crowd
            gave instructions to Alexander, whom the Jews had pushed forward. And Alexander motioned
            for silence and tried to make a defense before the people. But when they recognized that
            he was a Jew, for about two hours all of them shouted in unison, “Great is Artemis of
            the Ephesians!” But when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, “Citizens of
            Ephesus, who is there that does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the temple
            keeper of the great Artemis and of the statue that fell from heaven? Since these things
            cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash. You have brought these men
            here who are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess. If therefore
            Demetrius and the artisans with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are
            open, and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges there against one another. If
            there is anything further you want to know, it must be settled in the regular assembly.
            For we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no cause that
            we can give to justify this commotion.” When he had said this, he dismissed the
            assembly.

            And that's where the disturbance in Ephesus ends. The crowd, calmed both by the town
            clerk and the even greater threat of retributive violence from the Roman authorities,
            disperses and goes back to their business.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            But that's not the end for the Christians in Ephesus. Carved into stones all over the
            city is the ancient ἸΧΘΥΣ symbol. A combination of Greek letters, it stands for Iesous
            (Jesus), Khristos (Anointed), Theou (God), Uios (Son), and Soter (Savior). The letters,
            when merged into a circle, could be discreetly used by Christians, no doubt wary of
            being dragged back into the theater, to identify each other and their meeting places.

            The ancient city of Troy, immortalized in Homer's Iliad, is located in northwestern
            Turkey, along the Aegean to the south of Istanbul. Leading up to our visit in April, I
            read Emily Wilson's new translation of the epic poem. Wilson chose to render Homer's
            dactylic hexameter, which is a rhythm compatible with the original Greek, into iambic
            pentameter, which is better suited to English and used by most of our own great poets.

            It is a vivid experience. Here is just one example:

            He threw his spear at Pandarus.
            <br/>Athena steered it beneath his eye and through his nose,
            <br/>smashing his white teeth. Then the tireless bronze
            <br/>cut off his tongue, right at the root—the tip
            <br/>emerged again beneath his chin. He fell
            <br/>out of the chariot. His dazzling armor
            <br/>and shining weapons clattered all around him.
            <br/>His swift-hoofed horses swerved and galloped off.
            <br/>His life and spirit were released and lost.

            More than a movie, the Iliad was dozens of hours of premium television, sung by a bard

          <div class="section-body">
            Standing on what remains of the citadel of ancient Troy and looking out over the plain,
            beyond which the "swift Greek ships" would have been docked, was one of the highlights
            of my life.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            I could hear Hector's wife, Andromache, pleading with him to remain with her and their
            young son behind the "sturdy walls of Troy" instead of going out to face Agamemnon's
            coalition; and old king Priam, watching as Hector, his beloved son, was later chased down
            and mercilessly killed by Achilles; and Hecuba, Hector's mother, wailing on the
            citadel's walls as her son's body is dragged through the dirt back to the Greek camp.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            It's a brutal work, and a reminder of the devastating cost of war. In Achilles' own
            words:

          <div class="section-body-quote">
            If only conflict were eliminated
            <br/>from gods and human beings! I wish anger
            <br/>did not exist. Even the wisest people
            <br/>are roused to rage, which trickles into you
            <br/>sweeter than honey, and inside your body
            <br/>it swells like smoke—just so, Lord Agamemnon
            <br/>enraged me. But that happened in the past.
            <br/>So let it go, though I am still upset.
            <br/>I must control the feelings in my chest,
            <br/>and go to look for Hector, who destroyed
            <br/>the one I loved the most, my head, my life.
            <br/>Thereafter, I will welcome death, whenever
            <br/>Zeus and the other deathless gods may wish
            <br/>to bring it.

            I coded up the last two versions (this and the last one) of this site by hand. Raw html,
            css, and a few lines of javascript. Other than fonts, the only part I didn't write was
            a syntax highlighting library that I begrudgingly (yet without hesitation) included from
            Prism.js.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Practically speaking, writing the site by hand is worth it for me. In a business
            building a living, breathing piece of software, libraries and frameworks are great. For
            a personal site that I update once a decade, I'd rather not enter dependency hell every
            time I touch the code.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            My other motive is more philosophy than engineering. Pure html, css, and javascript will
            probably be runnable in 1000 years. Today's fashionable WYSIWYG site or blog generator,
            maybe not. I like the idea that my blog, which is not very special today, could somehow
            become a historical artifact in the future. Vain? Sure... But crazier things have
            happened!
            <div class="pb"></div>
            I was planning to commend this approach to others after finishing my redesign. At least,

            Civilization was like a mad dash that lasted five thousand years. Progress begot more
            progress; countless miracles gave birth to more miracles; humankind seemed to possess
            the power of gods; but in the end, the real power was wielded by time. Leaving behind a
            mark was tougher than creating a world. At the end of civilization, all they could do
            was the same thing they had done in the distant past, when humanity was but a babe:

            I am currently reading English historian Tom Holland's recent book, "Dominion: How the
            Christian Revolution Remade the World". I found particularly interesting this quote on page
            32:
          </div>
          <div class="section-body-quote">
            This spirit, this ferocious commitment to being the best, was one in which all aspired
            to share. In Homer's poetry, the word for 'pray', euchomai, was also a word for
            'boast'.
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            This passage resonated strongly with me having just finished the Iliad last month and
            subsequently visited the site of ancient Troy. Praying and boasting are, for Achilles
            and his friends, much more closely related than we see them today.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Euchomai was also used, with a very different meaning, a millenium later by Paul in what
            has become the most influential set of letters ever written. In 50 AD, Paul planted a
            church in Corinth that he would write to several times over the next few years. It was
            facing some pretty significant issues: adultery (1 Cor 5:1), lawsuits (1 Cor 6:1), and
            prostitution (1 Cor 6:15) to name a few. In 55 AD, he writes in his final extant letter
            to the Corinthian community:
          </div>
          <div class="section-body-quote">
            Examine yourselves to see whether you are living in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you
            not realize that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless, indeed, you fail to meet the test! I
            hope you will find out that we have not failed. But we pray [euchometha] to God that you
            may not do anything wrong—not that we may appear to have met the test, but that you may
            do what is right, though we may seem to have failed. For we cannot do anything against
            the truth, but only for the truth. For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong.
            This is what we pray [euchometha] for, that you may become perfect.
            <br/>
            <div style="height:5px;"></div>
            2 Corinthians 13:5-9
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Paul cares deeply for this community and wants the best for them. The last two lines are
            a stark contrast with Homer. Paul rejoices in his weakness if it means that his friends
            are strong, and in his weakness he is praying. The two statements can be read in
            parallel: weak/pray -> strong/perfect.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Paul's euchomai is my inspiration for this blog. You won't find any greatness here: most
            of my projects are half finished and my writing seems dated to me the very next time I
            read it. What I can offer is honesty and some of my small contributions to this world.
            Thank you for reading.

            This week, we will use JavaScript to explore the `Maybe` monad. We will first present a
            common problem that requires extraneous amounts of boilerplate code: null checking. We
            will then learn the properties of a monad and see how creating a maybe monad can isolate
            the boilerplate code required for null checks.

            Imagine that we work at a fictional web company. Our company has decided to consume
            Elgoog's Maps API. We will provide the API with a city and it will return to us the
            coordinates of that city's capitol. Elgoog returns a JSON object as their response. Here
            is a successful response to a query:
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var response = {
    'location': {
        'country': 'USA',
        'city': {
            'name': 'Boston'
            'coordinates': {
                'latitude': 1234,
                'longitude': 2345
            }
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            Sometimes, Elgoog doesn't give us all the information we need. For instance, they may
            not have the coordinates for our city, or the city we searched for may not exist at all.
            Here are two examples of responses that indicate failure.
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var badResponse = {
    'location': {
        'country': 'USA',
        'city': {
            'name': 'Boston',
            'coordinates': null
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var badResponse = {
    'location': null
}</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            Now that we know what form responses can take, let's write code to retrieve these
            coordinates from the response. We want to return an array containing the latitude and
            longitude pair.
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function getCoordinates(response) {
    var latitude = response.location.city.coordinates.latitude;
    var longitude = response.location.city.coordinates.longitude;
    return [latitude, longitude];
}</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            What happens when we call this code with the successful response?
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var coords = getCoordinates(response); // => [1234, 2345]</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            We're done! Not quite; we still haven't tested the failed lookup response.  Let's try
            that.
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var coords = getCoordinates(badResponse);
// => Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'latitude' of null</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            Looks like that won't work. JavaScript gave us a TypeError (Java would throw a
            NullPointerException). Do you see why the error is occurring? We are trying to access
            the `latitude` property of `null`. Of course, `null` doesn't have a `latitude` property,
            so JavaScript complains.

            To solve this problem, we need to perform checks in our code to test for `null` values
            before we access their properties. For better or worse, we can put all of these null
            checks into a single `if`-statement by using short-circuit evaluation.

        latitude = response.location.city.coordinates.latitude;

            Phew, that was a lot of null checks. Unfortunately, they are necessary if we are to be

            sucks.

            As it turns out, our current <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> function isn't

            Monad Laws
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            There are three 'laws' that must be followed in order to create a monad. These laws are
            like the math version of an interface. If our monads conform to these laws, then
            functions that act on the monad "interface" can be used on our monads. If we add a few
            more laws (which will be covered later on in our series) our monads can be used
            (stacked) with other monads.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Here are the laws in JavaScript. We will use <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code>
            for concreteness in these laws, noting that in a formal definition of the laws, more
            general notation is used.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Law 1: Left identity

            Bind
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            By now, maybe you've noticed that those laws use a 'bind' function that we haven't
            written yet. As it turns out, the bind function is the last piece in the monadic puzzle.
            Let's write one.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            As described in the monad laws, bind needs to perform an action on the value contained
            in our <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code>, then wrap the return value back up
            in another <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code>.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Let's take a look at the Haskell type signature for <code class="language-haskell">bind</code>.
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-haskell">Maybe a ->     (a -> Maybe b)     -> Maybe b
-- ^param 1     ^----------^param 2  ^return value</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            This signature tells us that the bind function takes a <code
            class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> (param 1) and a function that transforms a value
            (param 2) and returns a <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> that contains the
            transformed value. A common analogy for this process is opening a box (<code
            class="language-haskell">Maybe a</code>) that contains a value (<code
            class="language-haskell">a</code>), then transforming that value into another value
            (<code class="language-haskell">a</code> into <code class="language-haskell">b</code>),
            and wrapping the new value back up into the box (<code class="language-haskell">Maybe
            b</code>).
            <div class="pb"></div>
              Note: Because of JavaScript's weak type system, the type signature of our <code
              class="language-haskell">bind</code> function is actually <code
              class="language-haskell">Maybe a -> (a -> b) -> Maybe b</code>.
            <div class="pb"></div>
              Let's add the bind function to our <code class="language-haskell">Maybe</code> monad.
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">Maybe = function(value) {

            This week, we will cover some of the seminal functions in functional programming: Map,
            reduce, filter, and zip. These functions will largely replace our need for-loops when
            writing functional code.
            <div class="pb"></div>

            tracks users, their relationship statuses, and their incomes.

            Imagine that in our example application, we query our database to find users who are
            about to get married. The response to our query is a list of user objects, each of which
            contains the username and married status of a user. How do we update every user in this
            array so that their marriage status is <code class="language-javascript">true</code>?

            Before attempting to solve this problem functionally, let's derive a solution using our
            current knowledge. In an average CS class, how would this problem be solved?  The most
            natural solution is a for-loop.
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function updateUsers(users) {
    for (int i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
        users[i].married = true;
    }

          <div class="section-body">
            There are a few problems with this code:
            <div class="pb"></div>
            1. It's <i>not readable</i>. Even though there's only one for-loop, only a programmer
            would understand this "jargon." Deciphering for-loops, especially when nested, can be
            tricky even for experienced programmers.
            <div class="pb"></div>
              2. Adding more loops would cause our code to use <i>more indentation levels</i>. While
              largely a syntactic detail, it can be a nuisance to read heavily indented code, and we
              are in the business of writing code not for the computer, but for the reader.
            <div class="pb"></div>
              3. The loop <i>modifies our original array</i>. Not doing so would require even more
              code.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            While points 1 and 2 can't be solved easily, we can eliminate point three by creating an
            auxilary array. However, that introduces more complexity to our solution.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Can we do better? Yes! The map operator allows us to simplify this operation.
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function updateUsers(users) {
    // This is read as: "For each user in a new array, let
    // married be true."
    users.map(function(user) {
        user.married = true;
        return user;
    });
}</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            In the above code, the map operation applies the anonymous function passed as its first
            argument to every element of the users array. The map function then returns a new array
            with the resulting set of data; the original `users` array is left unmodified.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            What if we wanted to build a new array consisting of only the newlyweds names?

            Is this final example more readable than our for-loop? Yes! In fact, our intent is

            That's fairly readable, but I think we can do better. To improve this function, we will
            use a <code class="language-javascript">reduce</code> method. This method takes an array
            and reduces it into a single value.

            Reduce tends to be more confusing to newcomers than map and filter, but it's surprising
            how often it gets used. At least in this example, it may not be obvious where the
            improvement comes from. But when we start combining higher level functions to transform
            our data, the utility will be more obvious.

            Part of our function is functional, but we still have to pair the dogs in the first
            place. If we wanted to pair cats later on, we would have to write another pairing

            <div class="pb"></div>
            Well, unlike several other langauges, JavaScript unfortunately doesn't provide this
            functionality in the standard library. But, as witty functional programmers, we can add
            the functionality ourselves.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            What we want is a <code class="language-javascript">zip</code> function that takes two
            lists and "zips" them together. Like the above function, it will require the lists to be
            the same length.
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function zip(array1, array2) {
    if (array1.length !== array2.length) {
        return;
    }

    var pairings = [];
    for (int i = 0; i < array1.length; i++) {
        var unit = [];
        pairings.push(unit.push(array1[i]).push(array2[i]));
    }
    return pairings;
}</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            Now that we have a proper zip function, we can simplify our dog to owner pairing
            function.
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function pairDogs(owners, pets) {
    zip(owners, pets).map(function(pair) {
        console.log("Owner: " + pair[0] + " Dog: " + pair[1]);
    });

          <div class="section-body">
            You may have noticed that our <code class="language-javascript">zip</code> function
            still uses for-loops.  We probably could have written it so that we didn't need the
            for-loop, but I left it there to make a point: Sometimes it is helpful for us to isolate
            ugly, but necessary, boilerplate code in a higher level function that we can later use
            to write readable, maintainable code.  We will explore this idea further when we learn
            about monads.

            This post is the first in a 12 week series of sessions that I wrote for and teach at
            VandyApps, the programming club at Vanderbilt University. The sessions will explore
            functional programming topics in JavaScript and Haskell.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Welcome to the VandyApps Advanced Programming sessions. Let's begin.

          <div class="section-subtitle">
            Using a REPL
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Think back to CS 251. Did you ever wish that testing out a function or algorithm didn't
            require your entire project to compile cleanly? Sometimes it was a total pain to
            compile, run, and use your program, only to discover that a function or method didn't
            work as you expected it to. Some of you may have even created a <i>new</i> project just
            to test out that function in a clean environment that would compile cleanly.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Well, fear no more. Progressive™ languages have a solution for this problem, and it's
            called the REPL. REPL is an acronym: It stands for "Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop," and
            that's exactly what it does. It allows you to write code, import libraries, and more
            without compiling and executing (or interpreting) your whole project.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            If you've used the Python prompt in your terminal before, you've already used a REPL.
            Likewise if you have opened up the Chrome or Firefox developer tools to use the
            JavaScript console.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Let's open up the REPL in your browser to give it a whirl. In Chrome for Mac, the REPL
            can be accessed with the keyboard combination Cmd-Shift-C.
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">4 + 5 // => 9

console.log(4 + 5) // => 9

console.log("Learn. Design. Develop.") // => "Learn. Design. Develop."

// Hint: Use Shift-Enter to insert a newline in the Chrome REPL.
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i); // => 0 \n 1 \n ... \n 9
}</code></pre>

          <div class="section-subtitle">
            Welcome to JavaScript
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            JavaScript is a prototypal, weakly and dynamically (duck) typed language.  Let's break
            each of those words down.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            1. Prototypal — Most of the languages we work with in school are object oriented.
            Haskell, which we will look at later in the seminar, is purely functional. JavaScript is
            an oddball. It is prototypal, which means that new objects are created by cloning them
            from other objects. However, JavaScript is multi-paradigm, in that it can also be used
            in a functional or object oriented manner. We will focus on it's functional features in
            these seminars.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            2. Weakly typed — Unlike Python and Ruby, JavaScript is weakly typed.  Strongly typed
            languages will either not compile or throw errors when an incorrect type is passed to a
            function. In JavaScript, type conversions happen implicitly. Sometimes this can cause
            unexpected behavior.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            3. Dynamically typed — Unlike C++ and Java, when writing JavaScript you do not need to
            declare types in your code. The "var" keyword declares a variable and that variable can
            be reassigned to an object or primitive of a different type without throwing an error.
            This will save us some keystrokes and help us prototype code more quickly.
          </div>
          <div class="section-subtitle">
            Anonymous Functions
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Functions in JavaScript look like this:
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function doSomething(param1, param2) {
    // ...
}</code></pre>
          <div class="section-body">
            We can then call that function:
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">doSomething(1, 2);</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            What if we want to write a function that doesn't exist at the top level (in global scope
            in the case of JavaScript) - i.e. a local function? We can use an anonymous function,
            otherwise known as a lambda.
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function doSomething(param1, param2) {
    // We can set anonymous functions to variables.
    var myFunc = function() {
        var a = 1;
        var b = 2;
        return a + b;
    };

    // We can call that function in our code.
    myFunc(); // => 3
}</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            In the <code class="language-javascript">doSomething</code> function, we assign an
            anonymous function (so-called because it doesn't have a name when we define it) to the
            <code class="language-javascript">myFunc</code> variable.  We can then call that
            function by invoking <code class="language-javascript">myFunc</code>.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Anonymous functions give us the reusable property of normal functions, but with limited
            scope.
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function doSomething(param1, param2) {
    // Our anonymous functions can take parameters.
    var paramLambda = function(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    };

    paramLambda(1, 2); // => 3
    paramLambda(2, 3); // => 5
    paramLabmda(3, 4); // => 7
}</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            In fact, because they can capture their environment, lambdas can sometimes give us even
            more power than normal functions. When a lambda captures its environment, we give it a
            special name: Closure.
          </div>

          <div class="section-subtitle">
            Closures
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function doSomething() {
    var envVar = "I'm part of the environment.";
    var paramVar = "I was passed as a parameter.";

    // Closure property - Anonymous functions can capture
    // their environment.
    var closure = function(param) {
        console.log(envVar); // => "I'm part of the environment."
        console.log(param); // => "I was passed as a parameter."
    }

    closure(paramVar);
}</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            As you can see, the closure property simplifies our anonymous function by capturing its
            environment. That way, we don't have to pass so many parameters to our function. For a
            lot of simple operations that need to be reused within one method, closures are the best
            choice.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            But what if we decide that we want to use that lambda within a different function than
            the one in which it was defined?
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Here we have a <code class="language-javascript">userLogin</code> function that was
            written as a lambda and an example user object. The <code
            class="language-javascript">userLogin</code> function contains a lambda, <code
            class="language-javascript">loginStateChange</code>, that flips the state bit for a
            user.
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var johnDoe = {
    id: 1,
    loggedIn: false
};

function userLogin(user) {
    // loginStateChange is a closure – It captures the user object.
    var loginStateChange = function() {
        user.loggedIn = !user.loggedIn;
    }

    console.log(user.id);
}</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            At some point, we decide that we want to write a <code
            class="language-javascript">userLogout</code> function because our users are complaining
            that we track them on the internet.  Unfortunately, our cookie system is tied to a user
            login session, and we don't yet have a way to tell when to turn off our tracking
            cookies.
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function userLogout(user) {
    var loginStateChange = function() {
        user.loggedIn = !user.loggedIn;
    }

    console.log(user.id);
}</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            Hmmm... our <code class="language-javascript">userLogout</code> function contains
            copy-pasted code from our <code class="language-javascript">userLogin</code> function.
            Being the lazy programmers that we are, we don't want to maintain two sets of the same
            code. Fortunately, we're in luck. We can perform a "Lambda Lift" in order to move the
            anonymous function into the global scope.
          </div>

          <div class="section-subtitle">
            Lambda Lifting
          </div>

          <div class="section-body">
            Lambda lifting is when you "lift" a lambda out of the function where it resides and make
            it a top-level definition.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            When you lift a lambda, you must consider whether the lambda captures its environment
            (is a closure). If it does, you must make a parameter for every environment variable
            that is captured (or encapsulate all of them into an object and pass that object) in the
            new top-level definition.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            We'll lift the <code class="language-javascript">loginStateChange</code> closure into a
            top-level definition that we can reuse in both the <code
            class="language-javascript">userLogin</code> and <code
            class="language-javascript">userLogout</code> functions.
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Lifted lambda.
function loginStateChange(user) {
    user.loggedIn = !user.loggedIn;
}

// Now, we can rewrite our two functions that make use of the lambda.
function userLogin(user) {
    loginStateChange(user);
    console.log(user.id);
}

function userLogout(user) {
    loginStateChange(user);
    console.log(user.id);
}</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            Notice how natural the transition from lambda/closure to top-level function is. When you
            are developing software in a language that supports anonymous functions, many of your
            functions will begin life as helper functions that are specific to some top-level
            definition. But as requirements grow and the operation encapsulated by the lambda
            requires reuse, the lambda is lifted out of its environment and into the global scope.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            In short, lambdas, closures, and lambda lifting are all about optimizing code reuse.

            Founders are our generation's novelists. They buck the system. Strike out on their own
            path. But the road is treacherous. We listen intently as The Winners reminisce about the
            hard times - a failed venture capital round, maybe even a last-minute pivot at the end
            of their funding runway - and wish we had taken those chances. "But I have a family now.
            And property. And debt." Life gets complicated. Risks have real consequences. Finally
            comes the nostalgic, regretful admission. "I should have tried when I was young."
            <div class="pb"></div>
            After accepting our demise, we eagerly grab hold of the nearest young person.  Choking
            down our own regrets, we shriek, "<i>YOU</i> should take risks while you're young. It's the
            only time you can!"

            Before I continue, I must first make a confession. I founded a start up in high school.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            There I go again, playing fast and loose with the word "founded." What I really mean to
            say is that I sat in a garage for a few months cursing at the Facebook API documentation
            and reading tech news. Oh, and there was a shitty incubator in the mix somewhere. And a
            heap of embarrassing Ruby code.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            I was serious. I even wrote a college essay about the experience. A year later at
            university (that essay having convinced at least one admissions officer), I discovered
            how cliche my story was. To my surprise, many of my new classmates wrote remarkably
            similar essays... we were all founders!
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Yeah, I admit it. I was a wantrepreneur. But <i>RISKS</i>...
            <div class="pb"></div>
            ---
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Before and after my start up failure (at the time, failure was nearly as good as an
            IPO!), I was fortunate enough to work at real businesses.  Indeed, they too were start
            ups, but their founders had three tangible qualities that I as a young person did not:
            *Experience*, *Connections*, and *Funding*. If the founders I worked for were not
            equipped in these three areas, their companies would not have succeeded.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            I can tell you right now, almost no young people have these qualities. And that's why I
            believe that you shouldn't start a company while you're young.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            ---
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Before a hard object is thrown in my direction, I'll play devil's advocate.  "Aaron,"
            you might say, "what about all of the wonderful things that are learned by founding a
            company."
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Sure. You learn a ton by founding a company. In my own example, I learned hard skills,
            such as how to write and test (poorly designed) Ruby and Python code and provision
            servers; as well as a few soft skills, like how to incorporate a company (aka hire a
            lawyer), coordinate work with a co-founder, and save face in front of investors after an
            embarrassing pitch. Those are interesting, but they were not unique to the start up
            experience.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Programming, for instance, could have been learned more quickly in a classroom or job
            setting where I had someone to answer questions that I didn't even know to ask. Hiring
            lawyers just requires money, and pitching investors is not much different than demoing a
            new feature in front of management at an established company.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            I'm not arguing that <i>nothing</i> is learned by founding a company, only that there is more
            opportunity for young people to grow in an environment where there are mentors to learn
            from and mistakes don't have costly consequences.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            ---
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Now, let's address the three critical areas that most young founders lack.
          </div>
          <div class="section-subtitle">
            1. Experience
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Experience can be broken down into two broad categories: Soft skills and hard skills.
            Soft skills include, but are not limited to: networking, cohesive collaboration,
            resolving disagreements, hiring effectively, and managing employees. Hard skills
            include: programming, setting up infrastructure, selling product, allocating funds, and
            pitching to investors. Both categories are crucial to running a successful business, and
            if a founding team is severely lacking in any of these areas, it can jeopardize the
            company.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Working as an <i>employee</i> in either the corporate or start up world gives you an
            opportunity to improve your hard and soft skills in an environment where you (most
            likely) won't lose your job if you trip up. The pace in a corporate environment may be
            slower, but it can also leave time for reflection and perfection.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Most young people aren't experienced programmers, don't have the ability to sell an
            early stage product to an investor, and will frequently make rookie mistakes. Older
            founders, even if they are working on their first start up, have years of industry
            experience to draw upon. Even if that experience is too specialized or not in the same
            domain as their start up, general business experience itself can still make them more
            effective than a novice.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            In a start up, lacking hard skills like being able to sell or code efficiently can
            quickly kill your business. There is no shame in spending a few years in training before
            striking out on your own.
          </div>
          <div class="section-subtitle">
            2. Connections
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Connections in the start up world come in three primary flavors. Connections to
            potential customers, connections to quality engineers, and connections to money. In case
            you were wondering, yes, those are ordered in terms of relative importance.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Most young founders I have met envision themselves starting the next great social
            networking site. Why social networks? I believe it is because we have a natural tendency
            to look for ideas and customers in the market we know best.  Young people are drawn
            toward social networking ideas because <i>they</i> are the consumer. The underlying problem
            for these founders is that social networking plays, while easy to understand, are
            simultaneously some of the most difficult to execute on.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            The most striking contrast between the aged (as in fine wine) founders I've worked with
            and those my own age is that the older founders had 20+ years of industry experiences
            and connections to draw on when they built their business.  Ideas sprang from problems
            they were unable to solve within the organizational structure of a corporation they
            previously worked for, and they could easily recruit the cream of the engineering and
            sales crop whose loyalty they had earned over many years of collaboration.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Finding your first customers, usually a tremendous problem for young SaaS start ups, is
            easier by degrees when you have 20 years worth of late workdays and lunch meetings spent
            in the same room as your target audience. Your business model can even be guided by
            problems you yourself faced in the workplace. This alone is invaluable. And if you're
            smart, you may have even collected 20 years of favors to call in when it's time to find
            your first customers.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            On the financial side, older founders who save prudently can take less venture capital
            money, resulting in a bigger payday after an acquisition or (if you're <i>really</i>
            lucky) IPO. When experienced founders go looking for money, investors can use their
            track record in industry as another metric to gauge the company's likelihood of success.
            They have credibility.
          </div>
          <div class="section-subtitle">
            3. Funding
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            When people think of start ups, the menacing words "venture capital" are not far behind.
            It's unfortunate that venture capital funding is such a prevalent part of the industry,
            because some companies would realistically be able to "bootstrap" their way to
            profitability on the founders money alone (I've worked in a few, and believe it or not,
            it's possible!).
            <div class="pb"></div>
            A depressing number of the young founders I have encountered only spend enough time
            developing their business as is required to get them in front of a venture capitalist.
            This is somewhat understandable. Without money, not much can be done by a non-technical
            founder in technology. But it is highly unlikely (today, nigh impossible) that you will
            receive venture funding off of only an idea without a proven track record.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Older founders have two advantages here: First, they have the capability to save a
            significant amount of money before starting their business. This secures them living
            money while the business is starting, and also funds the company while it develops a
            product. Second, they have a track record that they can lean on to raise funding, and if
            they have already begun building their product, they may even have a few customer
            success stories as talking points.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            As was briefly touched upon in the "Connections" section, older founders can raise
            venture capital funding more easily if they have a proven track record and experience in
            the industry they are serving. Just this morning, I was browsing a few "Uber for private
            jet" companies. As I perused, I noted that the bio of every founder included a few
            sentences about their work in the air industry prior to starting the company. Their
            investors undoubtedly took this into account as they were deciding whether to fund the
            company.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Young people and inexperienced founders often look for funding as soon as they have an
            idea, only refining that idea with feedback from VC's. Without a track record, a
            product, or sales, no sane investor is going to risk even a small investment on an
            unproven entrepreneur. Ideally, looking for investor funding shouldn't be a skill or
            massive time investment - it should play a small role in the much larger picture of
            building a successful business.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            ---
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Before I close, I should point out that I'm not advocating that young people should
            <i>never</i> found companies. Most of what people say about being young actually
            <i>is</i> true.  You do have more free time, less obligations, and can sustain more
            risk, but those benefits aren't free. Being young comes with its own disadvantages,
            which I fear are too often overlooked by young founders and their (overly) supportive
            elders.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            If you are young, like I am, consider a longer term plan for starting a company; it's
            never too early to start saving. And if you're a little further on in life, maybe it's
            not too late to be a founder after all.

            Finishing side projects is hard. Actually, completing anything is hard, not only
            software. But I'll focus on the software case; otherwise, this post would be long enough
            to be published as a self help book, and I probably wouldn't finish that.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            This spring, as summer crept towards me (or perhaps I towards it), I envisioned
            reclaiming all of the free coding time that I've relished during previous summers. Time
            that I have previously used to tackle tutorials, build my first iPhone game, try out new
            frameworks, and learn unusual languages, all without the nasty obligation of homework.
            Summer is marvelous.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            But as I took a second, closer look at my imminent freedom, I realized that this summer
            would necessarily be different. All of the exciting projects that I worked on this
            school year, last summer, even the one before; well, not all of those projects are
            finished. Even worse, some of them need to be. And to top it all off, most of them
            aren't exciting to me anymore.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Somewhere in this fog of doom and gloom, there lies a new skill for me to acquire: The
            focus to finish a side project.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            This is no easy feat. Tying your half finished, hacked together, once exciting monthlong
            project up with a complete feature set and pretty bow (aka README.md) can be agonizing.
            All that refactoring, and incessant, prescribed bug testing... the horror! And just to
            release a few thousand lines of code? No thanks.

            is accepting defeat.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            A few of my own projects that are still lying around: Sudz, the aforementioned iPhone
            game from last summer... not released; Attrition, the previously blogged about machine
            learning project... not learning yet; the shell I wrote in Haskell... buggy and
            disorganized; Dockerizing the VandyApps forum... you get the picture.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            And there are so many more areas outside of personal projects that I wish I had made
            more progress on. From
            <a class="link" href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a>
            to
            <a class="link" href="http://smashthestack.org/" target="_blank">SmashTheStack</a>,
            all of these little ventures into massive time commitments give me the ghastly feeling
            that I haven't finished anything in the last year.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            But here's what I realized.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            <i>Nothing is wrong with leaving some things incomplete.</i>
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Imagine for a moment that I set out to finish every ideated feature of each of the
            aforementioned projects, ventured through even a quarter of Project Euler, and hacked
            into every level of only the IO portion of SmashTheStack. A liberal estimate would guage
            that undertaking at a year of unadulterated work - the pessimist would prescribe more.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            And guess what? I wouldn't have any fun in my free time. That is a no-good solution.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            With that synopsis in mind, it's tempting to abandon all of my projects and relieve
            myself of the stress of so many unfinished ideas. Start anew. Seek new ventures.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            <i>Wrong.</i>
            <div class="pb"></div>
            The lesson of summer 2015 is a compromise: Some projects are worth finishing outright,
            some must be set aside in their current state, and for most, I must settle on
            <i>finishing</i> a project with drastically reduced scope.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            In the first category falls Sudz, the iPhone game. I made a commitment to finish the
            game, with all of its features, and I will stick to that commitment.  It will be tough
            to finish, but it will be finished. Similarly with the VandyApps forum.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            In the second group is all of those little ideas I've spent a day or two on, but never
            completely hammered out. Project Euler and SmashTheStack are in this category for the
            moment. I will return to them at some point. Maybe on a lazy Sunday like this one, but I
            must accept that they will likely never be finished.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Most everything else exists in the third category. In fact, most side projects for all
            programmers begin must eventually fall into this category. Demanding that every ideated
            feature be included in the final release is a recipe for disaster. Isn't it ironic that
            in a business setting, we programmers we are often the first ones to carefully restrict
            the scope of a project; yet, in our own creative work, we easily fall for the same ruse?
            Perhaps we should take some of our own advice and be more careful with our commitments.

            waste, never to be seen again. Fortunately, only I know what was released and what was

            The Functional Programming Cult
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            As a novice functional programmer and armchair advocate of functional programming
            amongst my friends, I am occasionally asked why I spend time, the valuable asset that it
            is, learning obscure languages. It is unlikely that I ever write Clojure in my day job,
            and if I start a company, I certainly wouldn't choose Haskell. So why, in this void of
            practicality, have I invested the last year in these languages?
            <div class="pb"></div>
            In those conversations, and in this post, I use the concrete examples of Haskell and
            Clojure (at the risk of isolating functional programming to those two languages in the
            mind of my listener), but by no means are they the one true way. Many words have already
            been written about the particular merits of functional languages; I won't reiterate
            prior discussion on that topic. There are merits and faults to any programming paradigm
            and more qualified people have already discussed them elsewhere. Instead, I will discuss
            my own reasons for investigating these languages.

            Swimming: A 10,000 Hour Sport
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            In a former life, I was a competitive swimmer. Myself and my teammates trained ~20 hours
            a week, 50 weeks a year. Swim meets (i.e., competitions) were held perhaps once a month,
            and most swimmers would swim 6-8 events over the course of the weekend; accumulating
            anywhere from 500-1,500 yards or meters (more if they suffered through the mile on
            Friday evening).
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Our day-to-day training, of course, was nothing like the competitions we worked towards.
            Practices ranged from 5,000 - 10,000 yards on a daily basis, and we spent copious
            amounts of time on technique and form, drills, and hypoxic sets (breath-control
            training).
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Why, if the end result was a 200 meter sprint, did we expend so much time and effort on
            seemingly unrelated forms of training? The answer is common to sports, music, and any
            other activity in which the expert level performance is so drastically different than
            the novice's: We were stretching ourselves in many different, but interconnected areas
            that, during a race, all contributed to a quality performance.

            The Competitive Programmer
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Programming, like swimming, is a 10,000 hour class of activity. The novice is so
            completely unrecognizable from the expert as to render comparison useless.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Limiting oneself to programming in one or two languages, in the same family, at one
            level in the stack, is like showing up to practice each day and only swimming the events
            you plan to compete in. Peak performance is limited by such a narrow approach. The
            expert athlete strengthens their <i>body</i> with a wide range of interconnected exercises.
            To become an expert programmer [1], one must stretch his or her <i>mind</i>.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Haskell and Clojure, by being so completely different than the C-family of languages
            most programmers have been exposed to, are a fertile landscape in which the aspiring
            developer can stretch their mind. Is every concept learned from these languages going to
            be applicable in the programming version of a competition (e.g., interview, day job, or
            startup)? No. But by struggling with the paradigm shifts of these languages, your
            capacity as a developer will grow.  <i>I guarantee it</i>.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            This is by no means limited to functional languages. Other pursuits, like understanding
            memory management in C, diving deep into an assembly language, and exploring declarative
            programming in Prolog, to name a few, are all similarly beneficial in their own ways.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Many developers want to acquire skills that will make them a better prospective hire.
            That goal, by itself, is good. But if all pursuits are limited to the practical in order
            to meet a prospective employer's exact requirements, you surrender the opportunity to
            stretch your mind further by learning the impractical.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            [1] This is speculation on my own observations of other people -- I am not an expert
            programmer.

            As President (and formerly Vice President) of a university programming club, VandyApps,
            many requests for developers naturally find their way into my inbox. These requests
            largely originate from non-technical founders looking for technical partners (i.e.
            "coders"). Our club meets every week, so most founders will attend one of our meetings
            to pitch their idea to the club. Having seen many pitches in my time, I have developed a
            set of suggestions that will help entrepreneurs attract developers to their project.

            Finding a Developer is Hard

          <div class="section-body">
            First, a warning for first time entrepreneurs: Attracting developers to a project is
            hard. Really hard. No matter how good your idea is, convincing a developer to work with
            you is invariably going to be an uphill battle. After meeting with and hearing pitches
            from many entrepreneurs, I have collected a few common problems along with my proposed
            solutions. None of these solutions are going to guarantee that you will find a
            developer, but they will certainly help your chances.

            Problem: Unrealistic Timeline
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            In the vast majority of pitches I have seen, the non-technical entrepreneur greatly
            underestimates how much work is required for their project. This is a red flag for
            developers because they foresee a situation in which they are on the hook for a late
            project with an unrealistic timeline.

          <div class="section-body">
            It is nigh impossible to accurately estimate the length of a software project. However,
            consulting a friend who is a developer to get their opinion can help you approach a more
            realistic timeline. If you don't have any friends who are developers, here's a (poor,
            but acceptable) alternative: Multiply your estimated time length by 4. Also, be
            flexible; no one wants to be on the hook for a late project.

          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            NDA = Non-Disclosure Agreement. Some entrepeneurs ask developers to sign an NDA before
            hearing their pitch. Most developers will (and rightly should!) refuse. There is a time
            and place for NDAs, but the first meeting is not it.

            Problem: Misaligned Incentives
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            At VandyApps, we hear pitches from non-technical founders almost every week. Many of our
            members also maintain personal projects. Your idea is only one of many that our members
            can choose to allocate their time to. For a developer to join your project, the
            incentives must be strong enough to convince them to reallocate their time.
          </div>
          <div class="section-subtitle">
            Solution 1: Money
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Developer time is valuable. Many of our members graduate with jobs that pay over $100k,
            and many more have internships that pay over $10k for the summer. To be frank, your
            project is in direct competition with those jobs, because the time that a developer
            spends working with you is time that they are not spending preparing for interviews or
            making open source contributions. Offering money, even a small amount, can go a long way
            towards balancing incentives. Not only does it show that you are serious about your idea
            coming to fruition, but it also shows the developer that you consider their time
            valuable.

            Solution 2: Equity
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Offering equity is, in my opinion, a necessary token that non-technical founders must
            offer to technical co-founders. However, offering a measly amount of equity is sure to
            offend any reasonably seasoned developer. Remember that retaining lots of equity in a
            worthless company is worthless, so be generous when giving equity to developers -- in
            the end, your product lives and dies with their work. If equity is not offered, cash
            compensation must be much, much higher.

            Solution 3: Skill Development
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            If you already have another, experienced, developer working with you, use skill
            development as a selling point. VandyApps members want to become better developers, and
            working with someone more experienced is a great way to do that (that's why they come to
            VandyApps). However, if you do not have a more experienced developer on your team,
            trying to convince someone that coding alone on your project will help them improve
            faster than, well, working on a different project alone, is just tacky.

          <div class="section-body">
            One of the most powerful ways to show that you are committed to a project is to try

            for how to get started. Building something on your own, even if it sucks, shows
            potential partners that this isn't just an idea you had at a bar last Saturday. Doing so
            will also give you a more accurate estimate of how long the project will take. When you
            present to our club, show us what you made and explain what you learned; this is sure to

            Before you pitch to VandyApps (or anyone, really), you should perform quality market
            research. This will include evaluating competitors and surveying potential customers.
            Your idea need not be unique (according to Mark Twain, "There is no such thing as a new
            idea. It is impossible."), but flat-out ignoring competitors is a red flag. As a
            non-technical founder, you must demonstrate an aptitude for business skills, especially
            if you frame yourself as "the business guy/gal."

            But it's going to work.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            First, a disclaimer: I'm not working on this project because I want to make a fun game
            -- or a smart AI for that matter. I'm working on this project because I want to learn
            about machine learning. If I wanted a half-decent AI for this game, I would have written
            the recommendation/nearest neighbor system I described in my last post. But that would
            have been simple.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Today I want to take the project back to basics (and by that, I mean as complicated as
            possible; for learning purposes, right?). I'm reintroducing classification into the
            equation, but this time I (sort of, but not really) know what I'm doing.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            1. Instead of clustering all of the data collected, I'm only going to cluster data on
            the human opponent's moves. Why? Because making calculations based on raw health and
            unit numbers is easy, but making decisions based on the opponent's strategy is tough (if
            not impossible).
            <div class="pb"></div>
            2. I am going to use 3-5 clusters. Too many clusters will make classification unwieldy.
            These clusters will hopefully represent different strategies that a human player
            exhibits.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            3. Classification will use data that is labelled as belonging to one of the 3-5 clusters
            for training. Once trained, the algorithm's accuracy can be tested on a small amount of
            different labelled data.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            4. During a game, the machine can classify its opponent as belonging to one of these
            clusters. The opponent may be reclassified into a different cluster as the game proceeds
            if its strategy changes.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            5. The computer can use its guess of the player's strategy in order to formulate attacks
            that will do the optimal amount of damage to the player. For example, if the computer
            expects the player to deal an offensive blow with 90% of its soldiers, the computer can
            use 100% of its soldiers to defend, minimizing damage done.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            It is unlikely that this will produce a very effective AI. However, I'm very interested
            to see if the computer can learn to distinguish human strategies (or even if real human
            players exhibit discernible strategies at all).

          <div class="section-body">
            After writing my post about the clustering problem I ran into last night, I set my
            computer and the project aside until this morning. Instead of diving into the code
            today, I read several chapters of
            <a class="link" href="http://www.manning.com/owen/" target="_blank">Mahout in Action</a>,
            dug through Mahout documentation, and (most importantly) kicked back to let myself
            think.  The conclusion I have come to is that classification does not fit our
            application domain.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Originally, our vision for the Attrition project was that we would first cluster the
            simulated game data, resulting in a set of distinct groups into which we can then
            classify new games as they are played. While the clustering step still makes sense to
            me, the classification step does not. This is not a knock on classification, but rather
            my own (limited) understanding of it. I now suspect that what I previously understood to
            be classification is actually a nearest neighbor solution.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Consider a round during a game of Attrition. There is data on previous games that were
            won and it has been clustered. To choose a strategy for the computer in round N, plot
            the data available up to this point in the game (health, soldiers, player moves, etc.),
            ignoring any data that is not available yet (future rounds, total number of rounds).
            Then, select the cluster that is closest to this point that results in a win. Ideally,
            this would be the computer's best response to the strategy that the player has exhibited
            throughout the current game.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            I see a few problems with this approach. First, if the current number of rounds exceeds
            the number of rounds in a simulated game, does the simulated game data become useless?
            Second, will the computer get "stuck" choosing the same strategy repeatedly simply
            because it chose that strategy in the past, and how responsive will the computer be to
            changes in player strategy? Third, what is the benefit of clustering the data at all?
            <div class="pb"></div>
            From my research today, my incorrect understanding of classification appears to be more
            similar to the "nearest neighbor" approach -- wherein a strategy is selected based on
            how close it is in n-dimensional space to another, winning, strategy. But what is the
            benefit of clustering data if a nearest neighbor approach might give me a strategy that
            is more representative of the current game climate anyways? The only reason that comes
            to mind is that clustering might in fact create an "average" winning game in response to
            a particular strategy that is more ideal that any one of the individual games that are
            represented in that cluster. If this turns out to be the case, clustering is a
            worthwhile improvement -- but I have my doubts.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            While I am eager to continue implementing my ideas for the Attrition project, I am
            hesitant to continue until I have hammered out a clear plan for moving forward. I
            believe that I am closer to my goal after today's research, but I suspect that tomorrow
            I may again find myself discovering more of my own misunderstandings (my learning curve
            right now feels like a slow implementation of logistic regression - continuously
            approaching an ideal value, but at a decreasing rate). If I am completely off-base in my
            current approach, feel free to let me know in the comments.

            The Problem
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Our current strategy for clustering in our game attrition considers only a few
            parameters: computer health (maximize), computer soldiers (maximize), player health
            (minimize), player soldiers (minimize), and number of rounds (minimize). By clustering
            the data, I hoped to pick a strategy for each round of the game that would maximize the
            likelihood of a computer victory.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            This evening, after using Mahout's KMeansDriver to cluster this data, I fully realized
            what I have suspected all along -- these parameters alone do not give me a detailed
            enough picture of the game at any given point.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Consider two games. Both result in the same outcome; the computer wins with 50 health
            and 500 soldiers and the player loses with 0 health and 300 soldiers. However, in one
            game, the computer plays offensively against a defensive player. In the other game, the
            computer plays defensively against an offensive player. With my current clustering
            approach, the computer AI may choose to play with an offensive strategy against an
            offensive player -- likely resulting in defeat unless the computer has a sizable
            advantage in soldier numbers.
          </div>
          <div class="section-subtitle">
            A Possible Solution
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            To remedy this situation, I am considering a new approach. Instead of only clustering
            game outcomes, I should also consider the player and computer moves at each turn. I
            consider this "looking at the past". On the classification side, a round that results in
            a negative change in health of 3 should be preferred to a round that results in a change
            of 50, even if the final results of the games that those rounds occurred in were
            equivalent. I consider this to be "looking in the (hypothetical, but plausible) future."
            <div class="pb"></div>
            For this strategy to work, the clustering and classification steps should roughly be as follows:
          </div>
          <div class="section-subtitle">
            1. Clustering
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Cluster games based on health and number of soldiers for the player and computer at the
            end of the game, number of rounds, and the computer and player move for each round. This
            should stratify the clusters into strategies that are distinct beyond simply reflecting
            the outcome of a particular game. These clusters will ideally reflect the best strategy
            to combat a unique human player.

          <div class="section-body">
            Classify games based on the same characteristics that were used for clustering. When
            selecting a strategy, look for the strategy closest to the cluster that minimizes
            health/soldier loss for the computer and maximizes the loss for the player. I still need
            to do some research to decide if the second part is possible.

            3. Conclusion
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            With this new strategy for clustering my gameplay data, I hope to draw better
            conclusions for the computer to use during a game. The idea of using previous moves was
            already being considered, but selecting a strategy based on the soldier/health delta is
            new. Hopefully it will provide another layer with which I can differentiate good from
            bad strategies.

            The Game
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            This semester, I am working on a machine learning project, currently named Attrition,
            with a few friends. Attrition is a simple game that will serve as a playground within
            which we can learn about machine learning.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            The rules of the game are as follows:
            <div class="pb"></div>
            1. There is one human and one computer player.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            2. Each player in the game starts with 100 health and 1000 soldiers.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            3. Before each turn, each player chooses how many soldiers to attack with and how many
            to defend with. (defenders = 1 - attackers)
            <div class="pb"></div>
            4. About 10% of attacking soldiers will perish. There is a 10% increase in soldier
            population based on the number of defenders a player has for that round.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            5. Defending reduces the impact of an attack.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            These rules, while simple, can easily be expanded upon. A few examples that we have in
            mind are (a) allowing multiple humans to play against one computer and (b) adding
            another troop category (e.g. tanks).

            capability gives us access to machine learning libraries that are well maintained and
            documented. In addition, the language provides an interactive development environment
            where we can test various algorithms and their accuracy.

            This week, we reached the point where we need to begin working with machine learning. We
            have been watching Andrew Ng's machine learning lectures and are finishing up week four.
            The lectures have given us insight into how the algorithms we plan to use are
            implemented.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Our current plan for the machine learning aspect of the project was sparked during a
            dinner discussion I had with a Vanderbilt professor. It hinges on the idea that certain
            players will have unique strategies and that the computer can recognize and respond to
            those strategies in real time. The learning strategy can be broken down into two pieces.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            1. Clustering (or, unsupervised learning): We will simulate thousands of games with a
            Stochastic Simulation. This simulation will hopefully provide an ample amount of data
            from which we can make deductions about effective strategies. We plan to use
            unsupervised learning to identify groups of games where the computer was successful. At
            first, we will only be measuring success by the amount of health left at the end of the
            game and whether or not the computer won. The clusters that we hope result from the
            simulations will represent winning strategies that the computer used against human
            players that shared a similar strategy.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            2. Classification (or, supervised learning): We designed our game to be played for 15-20
            rounds in a single game. Throughout the game, the computer should become a "smarter"
            opponent. That is, the computer will choose a strategy from the clusters created in part
            1 to match the human's current strategy. After each round, the computer will have more
            data with which to work and will again use classification to choose a strategy for the
            upcoming round. Later on, we hope to feed the data we collect from real games against
            humans back into our clusters to maximize the effectiveness of our AI.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            We hope that classification and clustering together will give our AI the tools it needs
            to effectively combat human components. As mentioned above, we plan to expand the AI to
            be able to hand multiple human opponents synchronously.

            In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve bring upon themselves the downfall of punishment by
            expulsion from their home by eating the forbidden fruit in order to gain *knowledge of
            good and evil*. This is a wonderful allegory for the way many artificial intelligence
            thinkers frame the creation of Artificial general intelligence--once it is upon us,
            there is no turning back.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Artificial general intelligence (AGI for short), more specifically of the self-improving
            kind, is the sort of heretofore fictitious, sci-fi plot point that most everyone is
            familiar with at some level, but might not fully grasp. It is the idea of a computer
            that can perform all of the same functions as a human, from playing games to forming
            new, creative ideas. Self-improving AGI is AI that can modify its own source code to
            improve itself. I will be referring to AGI of the self-improving kind throughout the
            rest of this essay.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            This is a good place to point out that I, like many others in computer science, consider
            the most likely end-result for AGI to be "martian" rather than "human"--i.e. it doesn't
            have to flap like a bird in order to fly. The most likely path to AGI, given the
            overarching themes within AI research, is through applied mathematics, especially
            statistics.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            For a long time, discussions about the hypothetical end-result of AGI research did not
            interest me. I considered AGI to be an inevitability, and therefore largely ignored the
            possibility of negative consequences. This is because I was, at the time, only capable
            of imagining a human-like end-result.

            by Elon Musk along with some insightful comments by the podcaster
            <a class="link" href="http://www.dancarlin.com/common-sense-home-landing-page/" target="_blank">Dan Carlin</a>
            caused me to more closely consider the dangers posed by AGI. In his most recent podcast,
            Dan Carlin posed the question: Can a dog ever have even one human insight, even if the
            dog lives for one thousand years? If we consider that self-improving AGI may very
            quickly become so much greater than our own intelligence that the difference between us
            and it is like the difference between species', then do we really know what we are
            getting ourselves into?  What if, in the steady pursuit of knowledge, we make a similar
            mistake as Adam & Eve, one that there is no going back from?
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Another interesting aspect of the AI discussion is the idea that, upon invention of AGI,
            our first self-aware creation wouldn't even be made of the same building blocks as us.
            Isn't it strange that we have so many good examples of well-constructed life all around
            us that we don't even come close to fully understanding, and yet we may soon be able to
            create a new intelligent species? Even, perhaps, one far greater than ourselves, that
            has no known equivalent in the universe?
            <div class="pb"></div>
            It is also interesting to consider that our history does not contain a single instance
            of humans creating something whose intelligence or sophistication surpasses our own.
            Even in religious teachings, in which creation of intelligent life (us) is touched upon,
            you do not see God creating something greater than himself! All religious writings that
            I have encountered lean on the idea that the creator's greatness is above and beyond
            that of the creation. In the case of AGI, we are toying with the unexplored idea of
            creating something that <i>far</i> surpasses our own understanding. Perhaps this is what
            makes AGI so frightening to people like Elon Musk: Even in one thousand years, we may
            not be able to understand an insight that our creation has in one instant.

            As I look back on the last ten years of technological progress, I am stricken by the
            number of breakthrough technologies that lie in the intersection of mathematics and
            computer science. Of course, this isn't to say that other computer science achievements
            were orthogonal to mathematics--after all, computer science is, in reality, a field of
            applied mathematics--only that the developments that combine purely mathematical fields
            like graph theory and statistics with the unrivaled computing power of the 21st century
            are unique.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            In the same way that living matter and chemistry allow humans to make decisions, be
            creative, learn, and understand, silicon and electricity empower the computer. We may
            not understand how to recreate our own intelligence, but we certainly understand the
            binary simplicity of our semi-intelligent creations. But what role will mathematics play
            in the future of computing? My guess is that it will be larger than ever.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Five years ago, the only companies invested in hiring mathematically-inclined computer
            scientists and mathematicians were Google, Amazon, the NSA, and a select few other
            large, well-funded companies. Only a few years ago, starting a company that made heavy
            use of applied mathematics was impractical. Today, the landscape has changed. Open
            source machine learning libraries have made basic machine learning applications
            available to the hobbyist, the college start-up founder, and the aspiring engineer.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Where will this trend head? While I cannot say for sure, my guess is that the prominence
            of mathematicians and mathematics in computer science will only grow. Machine learning
            and neural networks are only the beginning. These fields will undoubtedly grow, with
            more specific subfields being developed over time, as is already happening.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            But there's a problem. The mathematics currently used for computer science AI
            applications is inelegant. While we are currently satisfied with simplistic Bayesian
            models applied to massive quantities of data, that will not remain the case much longer.
            In the past, quality data in high quantities was hard to come by. Today, data is no
            longer the limiting factor; but soon, mathematics may be.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            The best thing a university-bound or enrolled computer science student can do is develop
            a strong background in mathematics. Computer science with a heavy dose of mathematics is
            the next ten years of computing. We may not be able to make human-intelligent computers,
            but we can certainly create Martian-intelligent computers.

            were exceptionally experienced programmers who were able to make the most of the tools
            available to them without being distracted from the ultimate goal: writing code and
            producing a product.

            During my internship, I realized something that should have been obvious to me all
            along: Choose your tools wisely, stick with them, and start writing code. After my very
            first week at the company, I already felt that my programming abilities had improved
            dramatically. Spending time writing code, and a lot of it, is the only way to become a
            better programmer.

            This semester, my goal is to spend a little less time in my .vimrc and .tmux.conf and a
            little more time in
            <a class="link" href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/" target="_blank">SICP</a>
            and
