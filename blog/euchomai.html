            I am currently reading English historian Tom Holland's recent book, "Dominion: How the
            Christian Revolution Remade the World". I found particularly interesting this quote on page
            32:
          </div>
          <div class="section-body-quote">
            This spirit, this ferocious commitment to being the best, was one in which all aspired
            to share. In Homer's poetry, the word for 'pray', euchomai, was also a word for
            'boast'.
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            This passage resonated strongly with me having just finished the Iliad last month and
            subsequently visited the site of ancient Troy. Praying and boasting are, for Achilles
            and his friends, much more closely related than we see them today.

            Euchomai was also used, with a very different meaning, a millenium later by Paul in what
            has become the most influential set of letters ever written. In 50 AD, Paul planted a
            church in Corinth that he would write to several times over the next few years. It was
            facing some pretty significant issues: adultery (1 Cor 5:1), lawsuits (1 Cor 6:1), and
            prostitution (1 Cor 6:15) to name a few. In 55 AD, he writes in his final extant letter
            to the Corinthian community:
          </div>
          <div class="section-body-quote">
            Examine yourselves to see whether you are living in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you
            not realize that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless, indeed, you fail to meet the test! I
            hope you will find out that we have not failed. But we pray [euchometha] to God that you
            may not do anything wrong—not that we may appear to have met the test, but that you may
            do what is right, though we may seem to have failed. For we cannot do anything against
            the truth, but only for the truth. For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong.
            This is what we pray [euchometha] for, that you may become perfect.
            <br/>

            2 Corinthians 13:5-9
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Paul cares deeply for this community and wants the best for them. The last two lines are
            a stark contrast with Homer. Paul rejoices in his weakness if it means that his friends
            are strong, and in his weakness he is praying. The two statements can be read in
            parallel: weak/pray -> strong/perfect.

            Paul's euchomai is my inspiration for this blog. You won't find any greatness here: most
            of my projects are half finished and my writing seems dated to me the very next time I
            read it. What I can offer is honesty and some of my small contributions to this world.
            Thank you for reading.
