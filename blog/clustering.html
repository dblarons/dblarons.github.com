            The Problem
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Our current strategy for clustering in our game attrition considers only a few
            parameters: computer health (maximize), computer soldiers (maximize), player health
            (minimize), player soldiers (minimize), and number of rounds (minimize). By clustering
            the data, I hoped to pick a strategy for each round of the game that would maximize the
            likelihood of a computer victory.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            This evening, after using Mahout's KMeansDriver to cluster this data, I fully realized
            what I have suspected all along -- these parameters alone do not give me a detailed
            enough picture of the game at any given point.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Consider two games. Both result in the same outcome; the computer wins with 50 health
            and 500 soldiers and the player loses with 0 health and 300 soldiers. However, in one
            game, the computer plays offensively against a defensive player. In the other game, the
            computer plays defensively against an offensive player. With my current clustering
            approach, the computer AI may choose to play with an offensive strategy against an
            offensive player -- likely resulting in defeat unless the computer has a sizable
            advantage in soldier numbers.

          <div class="section-subtitle">
            A Possible Solution
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            To remedy this situation, I am considering a new approach. Instead of only clustering
            game outcomes, I should also consider the player and computer moves at each turn. I
            consider this "looking at the past". On the classification side, a round that results in
            a negative change in health of 3 should be preferred to a round that results in a change
            of 50, even if the final results of the games that those rounds occurred in were
            equivalent. I consider this to be "looking in the (hypothetical, but plausible) future."
            <div class="pb"></div>
            For this strategy to work, the clustering and classification steps should roughly be as follows:
          </div>
          <div class="section-subtitle">
            1. Clustering
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Cluster games based on health and number of soldiers for the player and computer at the
            end of the game, number of rounds, and the computer and player move for each round. This
            should stratify the clusters into strategies that are distinct beyond simply reflecting
            the outcome of a particular game. These clusters will ideally reflect the best strategy
            to combat a unique human player.
          </div>
          <div class="section-subtitle">
            2. Classification
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Classify games based on the same characteristics that were used for clustering. When
            selecting a strategy, look for the strategy closest to the cluster that minimizes
            health/soldier loss for the computer and maximizes the loss for the player. I still need
            to do some research to decide if the second part is possible.
          </div>
          <div class="section-subtitle">
            3. Conclusion
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            With this new strategy for clustering my gameplay data, I hope to draw better
            conclusions for the computer to use during a game. The idea of using previous moves was
            already being considered, but selecting a strategy based on the soldier/health delta is
            new. Hopefully it will provide another layer with which I can differentiate good from
            bad strategies.
