            The Game
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            This semester, I am working on a machine learning project, currently named Attrition,
            with a few friends. Attrition is a simple game that will serve as a playground within
            which we can learn about machine learning.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            The rules of the game are as follows:
            <div class="pb"></div>
            1. There is one human and one computer player.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            2. Each player in the game starts with 100 health and 1000 soldiers.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            3. Before each turn, each player chooses how many soldiers to attack with and how many
            to defend with. (defenders = 1 - attackers)
            <div class="pb"></div>
            4. About 10% of attacking soldiers will perish. There is a 10% increase in soldier
            population based on the number of defenders a player has for that round.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            5. Defending reduces the impact of an attack.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            These rules, while simple, can easily be expanded upon. A few examples that we have in
            mind are (a) allowing multiple humans to play against one computer and (b) adding
            another troop category (e.g. tanks).

            Why Clojure?
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            We are working on this project in Clojure. We chose Clojure because its Java interop
            capability gives us access to machine learning libraries that are well maintained and
            documented. In addition, the language provides an interactive development environment
            where we can test various algorithms and their accuracy.

            Machine Learning
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            This week, we reached the point where we need to begin working with machine learning. We
            have been watching Andrew Ng's machine learning lectures and are finishing up week four.
            The lectures have given us insight into how the algorithms we plan to use are
            implemented.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Our current plan for the machine learning aspect of the project was sparked during a
            dinner discussion I had with a Vanderbilt professor. It hinges on the idea that certain
            players will have unique strategies and that the computer can recognize and respond to
            those strategies in real time. The learning strategy can be broken down into two pieces.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            1. Clustering (or, unsupervised learning): We will simulate thousands of games with a
            Stochastic Simulation. This simulation will hopefully provide an ample amount of data
            from which we can make deductions about effective strategies. We plan to use
            unsupervised learning to identify groups of games where the computer was successful. At
            first, we will only be measuring success by the amount of health left at the end of the
            game and whether or not the computer won. The clusters that we hope result from the
            simulations will represent winning strategies that the computer used against human
            players that shared a similar strategy.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            2. Classification (or, supervised learning): We designed our game to be played for 15-20
            rounds in a single game. Throughout the game, the computer should become a "smarter"
            opponent. That is, the computer will choose a strategy from the clusters created in part
            1 to match the human's current strategy. After each round, the computer will have more
            data with which to work and will again use classification to choose a strategy for the
            upcoming round. Later on, we hope to feed the data we collect from real games against
            humans back into our clusters to maximize the effectiveness of our AI.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            We hope that classification and clustering together will give our AI the tools it needs
            to effectively combat human components. As mentioned above, we plan to expand the AI to
            be able to hand multiple human opponents synchronously.
