            The ancient city of Troy, immortalized in Homer's Iliad, is located in northwestern
            Turkey, along the Aegean to the south of Istanbul. Leading up to our visit in April, I
            read Emily Wilson's incredible new translation of the Iliad. She has rendered Homer's
            dactylic hexameter, which is (from what I understand) a natural choice in Greek, into
            iambic pentameter, which is better suited to English and used by many great poets
            including Shakespeare.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            What a vivid experience. Here's just one example:
          </div>
          <div class="section-body-quote">
            He threw his spear at Pandarus.
            <br/>Athena steered it beneath his eye and through his nose,
            <br/>smashing his white teeth. Then the tireless bronze
            <br/>cut off his tongue, right at the root—the tip
            <br/>emerged again beneath his chin. He fell
            <br/>out of the chariot. His dazzling armor
            <br/>and shining weapons clattered all around him.
            <br/>His swift-hoofed horses swerved and galloped off.
            <br/>His life and spirit were released and lost.
            <br/>

          <div class="section-body">
            More than a movie, the Iliad was dozens of hours of HBO television, sung by a bard who
            knew it by heart. It also contains moral lessons like this one:
          </div>
          <div class="section-body-quote">
            No man can get away
            <br/>from destiny, first set for us at birth,
            <br/>however cowardly or brave he is.

            The Iliad: VI 487-489 (Emily Wilson)
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Standing on what remains of the citadel of ancient Troy and looking out over the plain,
            beyond which the "swift Greek ships" would have been docked, was one of the highlights
            of my life.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            I could hear Hector's wife, Andromache, pleading with him to remain with her and their
            young son behind the "sturdy walls of Troy" instead of going out to face Agamemnon's
            coalition; and old king Priam, watching as Hector, his beloved son, was later chased down
            and mercilessly killed by Achilles; and Hecuba, Hector's mother, wailing on the
            citadel's walls as her son's body is dragged through the dirt back to the Greek camp.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            It's a brutal work, and a reminder of the devastating cost of war. In Achilles' own
            words:
          </div>
          <div class="section-body-quote">
            If only conflict were eliminated
            <br/>from gods and human beings! I wish anger
            <br/>did not exist. Even the wisest people
            <br/>are roused to rage, which trickles into you
            <br/>sweeter than honey, and inside your body
            <br/>it swells like smoke—just so, Lord Agamemnon
            <br/>enraged me. But that happened in the past.
            <br/>So let it go, though I am still upset.
            <br/>I must control the feelings in my chest,
            <br/>and go to look for Hector, who destroyed
            <br/>the one I loved the most, my head, my life.
            <br/>Thereafter, I will welcome death, whenever
            <br/>Zeus and the other deathless gods may wish
            <br/>to bring it.
