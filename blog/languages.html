            The Functional Programming Cult
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            As a novice functional programmer and armchair advocate of functional programming
            amongst my friends, I am occasionally asked why I spend time, the valuable asset that it
            is, learning obscure languages. It is unlikely that I ever write Clojure in my day job,
            and if I start a company, I certainly wouldn't choose Haskell. So why, in this void of
            practicality, have I invested the last year in these languages?
            <div class="pb"></div>
            In those conversations, and in this post, I use the concrete examples of Haskell and
            Clojure (at the risk of isolating functional programming to those two languages in the
            mind of my listener), but by no means are they the one true way. Many words have already
            been written about the particular merits of functional languages; I won't reiterate
            prior discussion on that topic. There are merits and faults to any programming paradigm
            and more qualified people have already discussed them elsewhere. Instead, I will discuss
            my own reasons for investigating these languages.

            Swimming: A 10,000 Hour Sport
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            In a former life, I was a competitive swimmer. Myself and my teammates trained ~20 hours
            a week, 50 weeks a year. Swim meets (i.e., competitions) were held perhaps once a month,
            and most swimmers would swim 6-8 events over the course of the weekend; accumulating
            anywhere from 500-1,500 yards or meters (more if they suffered through the mile on
            Friday evening).
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Our day-to-day training, of course, was nothing like the competitions we worked towards.
            Practices ranged from 5,000 - 10,000 yards on a daily basis, and we spent copious
            amounts of time on technique and form, drills, and hypoxic sets (breath-control
            training).
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Why, if the end result was a 200 meter sprint, did we expend so much time and effort on
            seemingly unrelated forms of training? The answer is common to sports, music, and any
            other activity in which the expert level performance is so drastically different than
            the novice's: We were stretching ourselves in many different, but interconnected areas
            that, during a race, all contributed to a quality performance.

            The Competitive Programmer
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Programming, like swimming, is a 10,000 hour class of activity. The novice is so
            completely unrecognizable from the expert as to render comparison useless.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Limiting oneself to programming in one or two languages, in the same family, at one
            level in the stack, is like showing up to practice each day and only swimming the events
            you plan to compete in. Peak performance is limited by such a narrow approach. The
            expert athlete strengthens their <i>body</i> with a wide range of interconnected exercises.
            To become an expert programmer [1], one must stretch his or her <i>mind</i>.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Haskell and Clojure, by being so completely different than the C-family of languages
            most programmers have been exposed to, are a fertile landscape in which the aspiring
            developer can stretch their mind. Is every concept learned from these languages going to
            be applicable in the programming version of a competition (e.g., interview, day job, or
            startup)? No. But by struggling with the paradigm shifts of these languages, your
            capacity as a developer will grow.  <i>I guarantee it</i>.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            This is by no means limited to functional languages. Other pursuits, like understanding
            memory management in C, diving deep into an assembly language, and exploring declarative
            programming in Prolog, to name a few, are all similarly beneficial in their own ways.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Many developers want to acquire skills that will make them a better prospective hire.
            That goal, by itself, is good. But if all pursuits are limited to the practical in order
            to meet a prospective employer's exact requirements, you surrender the opportunity to
            stretch your mind further by learning the impractical.

            [1] This is speculation on my own observations of other people -- I am not an expert
            programmer.
