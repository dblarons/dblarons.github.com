            I coded up the last two versions (this and the last one) of this site by hand. Raw html,
            css, and a few lines of javascript. Other than fonts, the only part I didn't write was
            a syntax highlighting library that I begrudgingly (yet without hesitation) included from
            Prism.js.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Practically speaking, writing the site by hand is worth it for me. In a business
            building a living, breathing piece of software, libraries and frameworks are great. For
            a personal site that I update once a decade, I'd rather not enter dependency hell every
            time I touch the code.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            My other motive is more philosophy than engineering. Pure html, css, and javascript will
            probably be runnable in 1000 years. Today's fashionable WYSIWYG site or blog generator,
            maybe not. I like the idea that my blog, which is not very special today, could somehow
            become a historical artifact in the future. Vain? Sure... But crazier things have
            happened!
            <div class="pb"></div>
            I was planning to commend this approach to others after finishing my redesign. At least,
            until I spent half a day reformatting the old markdown posts into html. What a waste of
            time!

            Civilization was like a mad dash that lasted five thousand years. Progress begot more
            progress; countless miracles gave birth to more miracles; humankind seemed to possess
            the power of gods; but in the end, the real power was wielded by time. Leaving behind a
            mark was tougher than creating a world. At the end of civilization, all they could do
            was the same thing they had done in the distant past, when humanity was but a babe:
            Carving words into stone.
