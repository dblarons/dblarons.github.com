            I've got a new plan; it's the same as the old plan.  But it's going to work.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            First, a disclaimer: I'm not working on this project because I want to make a fun game
            -- or a smart AI for that matter. I'm working on this project because I want to learn
            about machine learning. If I wanted a half-decent AI for this game, I would have written
            the recommendation/nearest neighbor system I described in my last post. But that would
            have been simple.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Today I want to take the project back to basics (and by that, I mean as complicated as
            possible; for learning purposes, right?). I'm reintroducing classification into the
            equation, but this time I (sort of, but not really) know what I'm doing.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            1. Instead of clustering all of the data collected, I'm only going to cluster data on
            the human opponent's moves. Why? Because making calculations based on raw health and
            unit numbers is easy, but making decisions based on the opponent's strategy is tough (if
            not impossible).
            <div class="pb"></div>
            2. I am going to use 3-5 clusters. Too many clusters will make classification unwieldy.
            These clusters will hopefully represent different strategies that a human player
            exhibits.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            3. Classification will use data that is labelled as belonging to one of the 3-5 clusters
            for training. Once trained, the algorithm's accuracy can be tested on a small amount of
            different labelled data.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            4. During a game, the machine can classify its opponent as belonging to one of these
            clusters. The opponent may be reclassified into a different cluster as the game proceeds
            if its strategy changes.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            5. The computer can use its guess of the player's strategy in order to formulate attacks
            that will do the optimal amount of damage to the player. For example, if the computer
            expects the player to deal an offensive blow with 90% of its soldiers, the computer can
            use 100% of its soldiers to defend, minimizing damage done.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            It is unlikely that this will produce a very effective AI. However, I'm very interested
            to see if the computer can learn to distinguish human strategies (or even if real human
            players exhibit discernible strategies at all).
