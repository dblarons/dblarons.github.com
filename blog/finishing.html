            Finishing side projects is hard. Actually, completing anything is hard, not only
            software. But I'll focus on the software case; otherwise, this post would be long enough
            to be published as a self help book, and I probably wouldn't finish that.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            This spring, as summer crept towards me (or perhaps I towards it), I envisioned
            reclaiming all of the free coding time that I've relished during previous summers. Time
            that I have previously used to tackle tutorials, build my first iPhone game, try out new
            frameworks, and learn unusual languages, all without the nasty obligation of homework.
            Summer is marvelous.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            But as I took a second, closer look at my imminent freedom, I realized that this summer
            would necessarily be different. All of the exciting projects that I worked on this
            school year, last summer, even the one before; well, not all of those projects are
            finished. Even worse, some of them need to be. And to top it all off, most of them
            aren't exciting to me anymore.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Somewhere in this fog of doom and gloom, there lies a new skill for me to acquire: The
            focus to finish a side project.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            This is no easy feat. Tying your half finished, hacked together, once exciting monthlong
            project up with a complete feature set and pretty bow (aka README.md) can be agonizing.
            All that refactoring, and incessant, prescribed bug testing... the horror! And just to
            release a few thousand lines of code? No thanks.

            Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain,
            difficulty... I have never in my life envied a human being who led an easy life. I have
            envied a great many people who led difficult lives and led them well.

            Teddy isn't my favorite historical character, but in this case, he's right.  Leaving
            <a class="link" href="http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/11/25/west-side-project-story/" target="_blank">unfinished projects lying around</a>
            is accepting defeat.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            A few of my own projects that are still lying around: Sudz, the aforementioned iPhone
            game from last summer... not released; Attrition, the previously blogged about machine
            learning project... not learning yet; the shell I wrote in Haskell... buggy and
            disorganized; Dockerizing the VandyApps forum... you get the picture.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            And there are so many more areas outside of personal projects that I wish I had made
            more progress on. From
            <a class="link" href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a>
            to
            <a class="link" href="http://smashthestack.org/" target="_blank">SmashTheStack</a>,
            all of these little ventures into massive time commitments give me the ghastly feeling
            that I haven't finished anything in the last year.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            But here's what I realized.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            <i>Nothing is wrong with leaving some things incomplete.</i>
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Imagine for a moment that I set out to finish every ideated feature of each of the
            aforementioned projects, ventured through even a quarter of Project Euler, and hacked
            into every level of only the IO portion of SmashTheStack. A liberal estimate would guage
            that undertaking at a year of unadulterated work - the pessimist would prescribe more.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            And guess what? I wouldn't have any fun in my free time. That is a no-good solution.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            With that synopsis in mind, it's tempting to abandon all of my projects and relieve
            myself of the stress of so many unfinished ideas. Start anew. Seek new ventures.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            <i>Wrong.</i>
            <div class="pb"></div>
            The lesson of summer 2015 is a compromise: Some projects are worth finishing outright,
            some must be set aside in their current state, and for most, I must settle on
            <i>finishing</i> a project with drastically reduced scope.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            In the first category falls Sudz, the iPhone game. I made a commitment to finish the
            game, with all of its features, and I will stick to that commitment.  It will be tough
            to finish, but it will be finished. Similarly with the VandyApps forum.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            In the second group is all of those little ideas I've spent a day or two on, but never
            completely hammered out. Project Euler and SmashTheStack are in this category for the
            moment. I will return to them at some point. Maybe on a lazy Sunday like this one, but I
            must accept that they will likely never be finished.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Most everything else exists in the third category. In fact, most side projects for all
            programmers begin must eventually fall into this category. Demanding that every ideated
            feature be included in the final release is a recipe for disaster. Isn't it ironic that
            in a business setting, we programmers we are often the first ones to carefully restrict
            the scope of a project; yet, in our own creative work, we easily fall for the same ruse?
            Perhaps we should take some of our own advice and be more careful with our commitments.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            This summer <i>is</i> going to be a summer for finishing things - just not everything. Some
            projects will be nicely wrapped up to be shown off on Github, while others will lie in
            waste, never to be seen again. Fortunately, only I know what was released and what was
            left behind.
