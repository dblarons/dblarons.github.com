            Founders are our generation's novelists. They buck the system. Strike out on their own
            path. But the road is treacherous. We listen intently as The Winners reminisce about the
            hard times - a failed venture capital round, maybe even a last-minute pivot at the end
            of their funding runway - and wish we had taken those chances. "But I have a family now.
            And property. And debt." Life gets complicated. Risks have real consequences. Finally
            comes the nostalgic, regretful admission. "I should have tried when I was young."
            <div class="pb"></div>
            After accepting our demise, we eagerly grab hold of the nearest young person.  Choking
            down our own regrets, we shriek, "<i>YOU</i> should take risks while you're young. It's the
            only time you can!"
            <div class="pb"></div>

            <div class="pb"></div>
            Before I continue, I must first make a confession. I founded a start up in high school.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            There I go again, playing fast and loose with the word "founded." What I really mean to
            say is that I sat in a garage for a few months cursing at the Facebook API documentation
            and reading tech news. Oh, and there was a shitty incubator in the mix somewhere. And a
            heap of embarrassing Ruby code.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            I was serious. I even wrote a college essay about the experience. A year later at
            university (that essay having convinced at least one admissions officer), I discovered
            how cliche my story was. To my surprise, many of my new classmates wrote remarkably
            similar essays... we were all founders!
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Yeah, I admit it. I was a wantrepreneur. But <i>RISKS</i>...
            <div class="pb"></div>
            ---
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Before and after my start up failure (at the time, failure was nearly as good as an
            IPO!), I was fortunate enough to work at real businesses.  Indeed, they too were start
            ups, but their founders had three tangible qualities that I as a young person did not:
            *Experience*, *Connections*, and *Funding*. If the founders I worked for were not
            equipped in these three areas, their companies would not have succeeded.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            I can tell you right now, almost no young people have these qualities. And that's why I
            believe that you shouldn't start a company while you're young.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            ---
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Before a hard object is thrown in my direction, I'll play devil's advocate.  "Aaron,"
            you might say, "what about all of the wonderful things that are learned by founding a
            company."
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Sure. You learn a ton by founding a company. In my own example, I learned hard skills,
            such as how to write and test (poorly designed) Ruby and Python code and provision
            servers; as well as a few soft skills, like how to incorporate a company (aka hire a
            lawyer), coordinate work with a co-founder, and save face in front of investors after an
            embarrassing pitch. Those are interesting, but they were not unique to the start up
            experience.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Programming, for instance, could have been learned more quickly in a classroom or job
            setting where I had someone to answer questions that I didn't even know to ask. Hiring
            lawyers just requires money, and pitching investors is not much different than demoing a
            new feature in front of management at an established company.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            I'm not arguing that <i>nothing</i> is learned by founding a company, only that there is more
            opportunity for young people to grow in an environment where there are mentors to learn
            from and mistakes don't have costly consequences.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            ---
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Now, let's address the three critical areas that most young founders lack.
          </div>
          <div class="section-subtitle">
            1. Experience
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Experience can be broken down into two broad categories: Soft skills and hard skills.
            Soft skills include, but are not limited to: networking, cohesive collaboration,
            resolving disagreements, hiring effectively, and managing employees. Hard skills
            include: programming, setting up infrastructure, selling product, allocating funds, and
            pitching to investors. Both categories are crucial to running a successful business, and
            if a founding team is severely lacking in any of these areas, it can jeopardize the
            company.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Working as an <i>employee</i> in either the corporate or start up world gives you an
            opportunity to improve your hard and soft skills in an environment where you (most
            likely) won't lose your job if you trip up. The pace in a corporate environment may be
            slower, but it can also leave time for reflection and perfection.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Most young people aren't experienced programmers, don't have the ability to sell an
            early stage product to an investor, and will frequently make rookie mistakes. Older
            founders, even if they are working on their first start up, have years of industry
            experience to draw upon. Even if that experience is too specialized or not in the same
            domain as their start up, general business experience itself can still make them more
            effective than a novice.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            In a start up, lacking hard skills like being able to sell or code efficiently can
            quickly kill your business. There is no shame in spending a few years in training before
            striking out on your own.
          </div>
          <div class="section-subtitle">
            2. Connections
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Connections in the start up world come in three primary flavors. Connections to
            potential customers, connections to quality engineers, and connections to money. In case
            you were wondering, yes, those are ordered in terms of relative importance.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Most young founders I have met envision themselves starting the next great social
            networking site. Why social networks? I believe it is because we have a natural tendency
            to look for ideas and customers in the market we know best.  Young people are drawn
            toward social networking ideas because <i>they</i> are the consumer. The underlying problem
            for these founders is that social networking plays, while easy to understand, are
            simultaneously some of the most difficult to execute on.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            The most striking contrast between the aged (as in fine wine) founders I've worked with
            and those my own age is that the older founders had 20+ years of industry experiences
            and connections to draw on when they built their business.  Ideas sprang from problems
            they were unable to solve within the organizational structure of a corporation they
            previously worked for, and they could easily recruit the cream of the engineering and
            sales crop whose loyalty they had earned over many years of collaboration.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Finding your first customers, usually a tremendous problem for young SaaS start ups, is
            easier by degrees when you have 20 years worth of late workdays and lunch meetings spent
            in the same room as your target audience. Your business model can even be guided by
            problems you yourself faced in the workplace. This alone is invaluable. And if you're
            smart, you may have even collected 20 years of favors to call in when it's time to find
            your first customers.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            On the financial side, older founders who save prudently can take less venture capital
            money, resulting in a bigger payday after an acquisition or (if you're <i>really</i>
            lucky) IPO. When experienced founders go looking for money, investors can use their
            track record in industry as another metric to gauge the company's likelihood of success.
            They have credibility.
          </div>
          <div class="section-subtitle">
            3. Funding
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            When people think of start ups, the menacing words "venture capital" are not far behind.
            It's unfortunate that venture capital funding is such a prevalent part of the industry,
            because some companies would realistically be able to "bootstrap" their way to
            profitability on the founders money alone (I've worked in a few, and believe it or not,
            it's possible!).
            <div class="pb"></div>
            A depressing number of the young founders I have encountered only spend enough time
            developing their business as is required to get them in front of a venture capitalist.
            This is somewhat understandable. Without money, not much can be done by a non-technical
            founder in technology. But it is highly unlikely (today, nigh impossible) that you will
            receive venture funding off of only an idea without a proven track record.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Older founders have two advantages here: First, they have the capability to save a
            significant amount of money before starting their business. This secures them living
            money while the business is starting, and also funds the company while it develops a
            product. Second, they have a track record that they can lean on to raise funding, and if
            they have already begun building their product, they may even have a few customer
            success stories as talking points.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            As was briefly touched upon in the "Connections" section, older founders can raise
            venture capital funding more easily if they have a proven track record and experience in
            the industry they are serving. Just this morning, I was browsing a few "Uber for private
            jet" companies. As I perused, I noted that the bio of every founder included a few
            sentences about their work in the air industry prior to starting the company. Their
            investors undoubtedly took this into account as they were deciding whether to fund the
            company.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Young people and inexperienced founders often look for funding as soon as they have an
            idea, only refining that idea with feedback from VC's. Without a track record, a
            product, or sales, no sane investor is going to risk even a small investment on an
            unproven entrepreneur. Ideally, looking for investor funding shouldn't be a skill or
            massive time investment - it should play a small role in the much larger picture of
            building a successful business.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            ---
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Before I close, I should point out that I'm not advocating that young people should
            <i>never</i> found companies. Most of what people say about being young actually
            <i>is</i> true.  You do have more free time, less obligations, and can sustain more
            risk, but those benefits aren't free. Being young comes with its own disadvantages,
            which I fear are too often overlooked by young founders and their (overly) supportive
            elders.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            If you are young, like I am, consider a longer term plan for starting a company; it's
            never too early to start saving. And if you're a little further on in life, maybe it's
            not too late to be a founder after all.
