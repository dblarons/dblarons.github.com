            As President (and formerly Vice President) of a university programming club, VandyApps,
            many requests for developers naturally find their way into my inbox. These requests
            largely originate from non-technical founders looking for technical partners (i.e.
            "coders"). Our club meets every week, so most founders will attend one of our meetings
            to pitch their idea to the club. Having seen many pitches in my time, I have developed a
            set of suggestions that will help entrepreneurs attract developers to their project.

            Finding a Developer is Hard
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            First, a warning for first time entrepreneurs: Attracting developers to a project is
            hard. Really hard. No matter how good your idea is, convincing a developer to work with
            you is invariably going to be an uphill battle. After meeting with and hearing pitches
            from many entrepreneurs, I have collected a few common problems along with my proposed
            solutions. None of these solutions are going to guarantee that you will find a
            developer, but they will certainly help your chances.

            Problem: Unrealistic Timeline
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            In the vast majority of pitches I have seen, the non-technical entrepreneur greatly
            underestimates how much work is required for their project. This is a red flag for
            developers because they foresee a situation in which they are on the hook for a late
            project with an unrealistic timeline.
          </div>
          <div class="section-subtitle">
            Solution: Improve your Timeline
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            It is nigh impossible to accurately estimate the length of a software project. However,
            consulting a friend who is a developer to get their opinion can help you approach a more
            realistic timeline. If you don't have any friends who are developers, here's a (poor,
            but acceptable) alternative: Multiply your estimated time length by 4. Also, be
            flexible; no one wants to be on the hook for a late project.

          <div class="section-subtitle">
            Problem: Superfluous NDAs
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            NDA = Non-Disclosure Agreement. Some entrepeneurs ask developers to sign an NDA before
            hearing their pitch. Most developers will (and rightly should!) refuse. There is a time
            and place for NDAs, but the first meeting is not it.
          </div>
          <div class="section-subtitle">
            Solution: Share Your Idea Before Asking for a Signed NDA
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Don't have developers sign an NDA before hearing your idea. You can read more about why
            <a class="link" href="http://blog.jpl-consulting.com/2012/04/why-i-wont-sign-your-nda/" target="_blank">here</a>.
            If you ask me to have our entire club sign NDA agreements before your visit, I will
            refuse. Please don't do that.

          <div class="section-subtitle">
            Problem: Misaligned Incentives
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            At VandyApps, we hear pitches from non-technical founders almost every week. Many of our
            members also maintain personal projects. Your idea is only one of many that our members
            can choose to allocate their time to. For a developer to join your project, the
            incentives must be strong enough to convince them to reallocate their time.
          </div>
          <div class="section-subtitle">
            Solution 1: Money
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Developer time is valuable. Many of our members graduate with jobs that pay over $100k,
            and many more have internships that pay over $10k for the summer. To be frank, your
            project is in direct competition with those jobs, because the time that a developer
            spends working with you is time that they are not spending preparing for interviews or
            making open source contributions. Offering money, even a small amount, can go a long way
            towards balancing incentives. Not only does it show that you are serious about your idea
            coming to fruition, but it also shows the developer that you consider their time
            valuable.
          </div>
          <div class="section-subtitle">
            Solution 2: Equity
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Offering equity is, in my opinion, a necessary token that non-technical founders must
            offer to technical co-founders. However, offering a measly amount of equity is sure to
            offend any reasonably seasoned developer. Remember that retaining lots of equity in a
            worthless company is worthless, so be generous when giving equity to developers -- in
            the end, your product lives and dies with their work. If equity is not offered, cash
            compensation must be much, much higher.
          </div>
          <div class="section-subtitle">
            Solution 3: Skill Development
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            If you already have another, experienced, developer working with you, use skill
            development as a selling point. VandyApps members want to become better developers, and
            working with someone more experienced is a great way to do that (that's why they come to
            VandyApps). However, if you do not have a more experienced developer on your team,
            trying to convince someone that coding alone on your project will help them improve
            faster than, well, working on a different project alone, is just tacky.
          </div>
          <div class="section-subtitle">
            Solution 4: Learn to Code
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            One of the most powerful ways to show that you are committed to a project is to try
            building it yourself. Check out my post about learning to code for how to get started.
            Building something on your own, even if it sucks, shows potential partners that this
            isn't just an idea you had at a bar last Saturday. Doing so will also give you a more
            accurate estimate of how long the project will take. When you present to our club, show
            us what you made and explain what you learned; this is sure to to impress us.

          <div class="section-subtitle">
            Solution 5: Quality Market Research
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Before you pitch to VandyApps (or anyone, really), you should perform quality market
            research. This will include evaluating competitors and surveying potential customers.
            Your idea need not be unique (according to Mark Twain, "There is no such thing as a new
            idea. It is impossible."), but flat-out ignoring competitors is a red flag. As a
            non-technical founder, you must demonstrate an aptitude for business skills, especially
            if you frame yourself as "the business guy/gal."

            We at VandyApps understand that you are anxious to get started, and we want to help you
            as much as possible. Following the above guidelines gives your idea a much better chance
            of coming to fruition.
