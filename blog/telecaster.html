            Jimmy Page has been my favorite guitarist ever since I first saw <i>It Might Get
            Loud</i>.  Since then I've listened to hundreds or thousands of hours of Led Zeppelin
            albums and they still never get old.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Page doesn't just make playing guitar look easy - he makes it look downright sloppy.
            Here's my favorite clip from the movie:
          </div>
          <iframe width="100%" style="margin-top:10px; aspect-ratio:16/9;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gDsbOraiqg?si=TGswLHJxoxODzEo5" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            He's not just playing guitar, he's playing time itself!
            <div class="pb"></div>
            When I first saw this clip in high school, I was playing an Epiphone Les Paul; the same
            design, albeit considerably cheaper, that Page plays in the clip. I upgraded to an
            American Telecaster a few years later and have played the same guitar ever since.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            The Telecaster is almost the perfect guitar. Page, most closely associated with his
            "Number 1" Les Paul today, actually played a Telecaster on the first Led Zeppelin album.
            (Led Zeppelin was recorded in about 30 hours of studio time - start to finish, including
            mixing - over the course of only 3 weeks. What a band.)
            <div class="pb"></div>
            My philosophy when playing guitar is to never achieve with a pedal what I can do with
            nature. In the video, Page overdrives his amp not with a pedal, but by switching from
            his neck pickup (set to a lower volume) to his bridge pickup (set to a higher volume).
            What results is the basic physical reality of his guitar's voltage swinging too high for
            the amp and getting clipped... overdrive.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            You can't play <i>Ramble On</i> the way Page does in this clip with a standard
            Telecaster. A Telecaster has a three way switch, a volume knob, and a tone knob. While
            you can switch between the neck and bridge, you can't set them to two different volumes.
            There's only one volume knob controlling both pickups. Fender addresses this with their
            dual volume Telecaster Deluxe, but in the process sacrifices the most important thing of
            all - the iconic Telecaster look.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            After years of being bothered by this and seeing no reason (or room in our Brooklyn
            apartment) to buy a Les Paul Standard, I ordered a soldering iron and resolved to crack
            open my beloved guitar.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            After careful consideration, I decided on the following modifications:
            <div class="pb"></div>
            1. Two volume knobs, so you can quickly and naturally overdrive the guitar.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            2. A Les Paul three way switch because it is in every way superior to the Telecaster's.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            3. No tone knob, cause who uses it anyways?
            <div class="pb"></div>
            4. A two way series/parallel switch.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            The first two points are obvious given what I described above. The latter two were forced
            on me by space constraints, but necessity being the mother of invention, I dare say I've
            perfected the Telecaster.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            The last dial on a standard Telecaster, the tone knob, is pretty useless. I'd argue the
            only time it <i>is</i> used is to show off, which really just makes my point. Replacing
            it with a second volume knob is a common modification.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            But the tone knob, however flawed, does represent an ideal: it's nice to have options!
            Even if those options are (if we're being honest) "spin it to one end" and "spin it to
            the other end".
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Since most players' tone knob experience is practically binary, I decided to both
            approximate and improve on that real world reality with a two way series/parallel
            switch.  I'll skip what that means in detail, but imagine it as a switch between "more
            signal" and "a little less signal".
            <div class="pb"></div>
            When I set out to make this change, I figured someone must have already done this. And
            perhaps they have... but not on the internet. I could not find a single wiring diagram
            online.  With no soldering experience and having never modified a guitar before in my
            life, I drew my own diagram and learned how to solder.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            The result is the perfect Telecaster. In parallel, the guitar plays and sounds like you
            just got it from the factory. It still looks like a Telecaster, yet the switch offers a
            Les Paul's dynamic flexibility. And in series, there's even more drive.  Sweet
            perfection.
