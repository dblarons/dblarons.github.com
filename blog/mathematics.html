            As I look back on the last ten years of technological progress, I am stricken by the
            number of breakthrough technologies that lie in the intersection of mathematics and
            computer science. Of course, this isn't to say that other computer science achievements
            were orthogonal to mathematics--after all, computer science is, in reality, a field of
            applied mathematics--only that the developments that combine purely mathematical fields
            like graph theory and statistics with the unrivaled computing power of the 21st century
            are unique.

            In the same way that living matter and chemistry allow humans to make decisions, be
            creative, learn, and understand, silicon and electricity empower the computer. We may
            not understand how to recreate our own intelligence, but we certainly understand the
            binary simplicity of our semi-intelligent creations. But what role will mathematics play
            in the future of computing? My guess is that it will be larger than ever.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Five years ago, the only companies invested in hiring mathematically-inclined computer
            scientists and mathematicians were Google, Amazon, the NSA, and a select few other
            large, well-funded companies. Only a few years ago, starting a company that made heavy
            use of applied mathematics was impractical. Today, the landscape has changed. Open
            source machine learning libraries have made basic machine learning applications
            available to the hobbyist, the college start-up founder, and the aspiring engineer.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Where will this trend head? While I cannot say for sure, my guess is that the prominence
            of mathematicians and mathematics in computer science will only grow. Machine learning
            and neural networks are only the beginning. These fields will undoubtedly grow, with
            more specific subfields being developed over time, as is already happening.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            But there's a problem. The mathematics currently used for computer science AI
            applications is inelegant. While we are currently satisfied with simplistic Bayesian
            models applied to massive quantities of data, that will not remain the case much longer.
            In the past, quality data in high quantities was hard to come by. Today, data is no
            longer the limiting factor; but soon, mathematics may be.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            The best thing a university-bound or enrolled computer science student can do is develop
            a strong background in mathematics. Computer science with a heavy dose of mathematics is
            the next ten years of computing. We may not be able to make human-intelligent computers,
            but we can certainly create Martian-intelligent computers.
