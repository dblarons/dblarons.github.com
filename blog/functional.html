          <div class="section-body">
            This post is the first in a 12 week series of sessions that I wrote for and teach at
            VandyApps, the programming club at Vanderbilt University. The sessions will explore
            functional programming topics in JavaScript and Haskell.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Welcome to the VandyApps Advanced Programming sessions. Let's begin.
          </div>
          <div class="section-subtitle">
            Using a REPL
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Think back to CS 251. Did you ever wish that testing out a function or algorithm didn't
            require your entire project to compile cleanly? Sometimes it was a total pain to
            compile, run, and use your program, only to discover that a function or method didn't
            work as you expected it to. Some of you may have even created a <i>new</i> project just
            to test out that function in a clean environment that would compile cleanly.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Well, fear no more. Progressive™ languages have a solution for this problem, and it's
            called the REPL. REPL is an acronym: It stands for "Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop," and
            that's exactly what it does. It allows you to write code, import libraries, and more
            without compiling and executing (or interpreting) your whole project.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            If you've used the Python prompt in your terminal before, you've already used a REPL.
            Likewise if you have opened up the Chrome or Firefox developer tools to use the
            JavaScript console.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Let's open up the REPL in your browser to give it a whirl. In Chrome for Mac, the REPL
            can be accessed with the keyboard combination Cmd-Shift-C.
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">4 + 5 // => 9

console.log(4 + 5) // => 9

console.log("Learn. Design. Develop.") // => "Learn. Design. Develop."

// Hint: Use Shift-Enter to insert a newline in the Chrome REPL.
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i); // => 0 \n 1 \n ... \n 9
}</code></pre>

          <div class="section-subtitle">
            Welcome to JavaScript
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            JavaScript is a prototypal, weakly and dynamically (duck) typed language.  Let's break
            each of those words down.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            1. Prototypal — Most of the languages we work with in school are object oriented.
            Haskell, which we will look at later in the seminar, is purely functional. JavaScript is
            an oddball. It is prototypal, which means that new objects are created by cloning them
            from other objects. However, JavaScript is multi-paradigm, in that it can also be used
            in a functional or object oriented manner. We will focus on it's functional features in
            these seminars.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            2. Weakly typed — Unlike Python and Ruby, JavaScript is weakly typed.  Strongly typed
            languages will either not compile or throw errors when an incorrect type is passed to a
            function. In JavaScript, type conversions happen implicitly. Sometimes this can cause
            unexpected behavior.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            3. Dynamically typed — Unlike C++ and Java, when writing JavaScript you do not need to
            declare types in your code. The "var" keyword declares a variable and that variable can
            be reassigned to an object or primitive of a different type without throwing an error.
            This will save us some keystrokes and help us prototype code more quickly.
          </div>
          <div class="section-subtitle">
            Anonymous Functions
          </div>
          <div class="section-body">
            Functions in JavaScript look like this:
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function doSomething(param1, param2) {
    // ...
}</code></pre>
          <div class="section-body">
            We can then call that function:
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">doSomething(1, 2);</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            What if we want to write a function that doesn't exist at the top level (in global scope
            in the case of JavaScript) - i.e. a local function? We can use an anonymous function,
            otherwise known as a lambda.
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function doSomething(param1, param2) {
    // We can set anonymous functions to variables.
    var myFunc = function() {
        var a = 1;
        var b = 2;
        return a + b;
    };

    // We can call that function in our code.
    myFunc(); // => 3
}</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            In the <code class="language-javascript">doSomething</code> function, we assign an
            anonymous function (so-called because it doesn't have a name when we define it) to the
            <code class="language-javascript">myFunc</code> variable.  We can then call that
            function by invoking <code class="language-javascript">myFunc</code>.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Anonymous functions give us the reusable property of normal functions, but with limited
            scope.
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function doSomething(param1, param2) {
    // Our anonymous functions can take parameters.
    var paramLambda = function(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    };

    paramLambda(1, 2); // => 3
    paramLambda(2, 3); // => 5
    paramLabmda(3, 4); // => 7
}</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            In fact, because they can capture their environment, lambdas can sometimes give us even
            more power than normal functions. When a lambda captures its environment, we give it a
            special name: Closure.
          </div>

          <div class="section-subtitle">
            Closures
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function doSomething() {
    var envVar = "I'm part of the environment.";
    var paramVar = "I was passed as a parameter.";

    // Closure property - Anonymous functions can capture
    // their environment.
    var closure = function(param) {
        console.log(envVar); // => "I'm part of the environment."
        console.log(param); // => "I was passed as a parameter."
    }

    closure(paramVar);
}</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            As you can see, the closure property simplifies our anonymous function by capturing its
            environment. That way, we don't have to pass so many parameters to our function. For a
            lot of simple operations that need to be reused within one method, closures are the best
            choice.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            But what if we decide that we want to use that lambda within a different function than
            the one in which it was defined?
            <div class="pb"></div>
            Here we have a <code class="language-javascript">userLogin</code> function that was
            written as a lambda and an example user object. The <code
            class="language-javascript">userLogin</code> function contains a lambda, <code
            class="language-javascript">loginStateChange</code>, that flips the state bit for a
            user.
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var johnDoe = {
    id: 1,
    loggedIn: false
};

function userLogin(user) {
    // loginStateChange is a closure – It captures the user object.
    var loginStateChange = function() {
        user.loggedIn = !user.loggedIn;
    }

    console.log(user.id);
}</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            At some point, we decide that we want to write a <code
            class="language-javascript">userLogout</code> function because our users are complaining
            that we track them on the internet.  Unfortunately, our cookie system is tied to a user
            login session, and we don't yet have a way to tell when to turn off our tracking
            cookies.
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">function userLogout(user) {
    var loginStateChange = function() {
        user.loggedIn = !user.loggedIn;
    }

    console.log(user.id);
}</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            Hmmm... our <code class="language-javascript">userLogout</code> function contains
            copy-pasted code from our <code class="language-javascript">userLogin</code> function.
            Being the lazy programmers that we are, we don't want to maintain two sets of the same
            code. Fortunately, we're in luck. We can perform a "Lambda Lift" in order to move the
            anonymous function into the global scope.
          </div>

          <div class="section-subtitle">
            Lambda Lifting
          </div>

          <div class="section-body">
            Lambda lifting is when you "lift" a lambda out of the function where it resides and make
            it a top-level definition.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            When you lift a lambda, you must consider whether the lambda captures its environment
            (is a closure). If it does, you must make a parameter for every environment variable
            that is captured (or encapsulate all of them into an object and pass that object) in the
            new top-level definition.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            We'll lift the <code class="language-javascript">loginStateChange</code> closure into a
            top-level definition that we can reuse in both the <code
            class="language-javascript">userLogin</code> and <code
            class="language-javascript">userLogout</code> functions.
          </div>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Lifted lambda.
function loginStateChange(user) {
    user.loggedIn = !user.loggedIn;
}

// Now, we can rewrite our two functions that make use of the lambda.
function userLogin(user) {
    loginStateChange(user);
    console.log(user.id);
}

function userLogout(user) {
    loginStateChange(user);
    console.log(user.id);
}</code></pre>

          <div class="section-body">
            Notice how natural the transition from lambda/closure to top-level function is. When you
            are developing software in a language that supports anonymous functions, many of your
            functions will begin life as helper functions that are specific to some top-level
            definition. But as requirements grow and the operation encapsulated by the lambda
            requires reuse, the lambda is lifted out of its environment and into the global scope.
            <div class="pb"></div>
            In short, lambdas, closures, and lambda lifting are all about optimizing code reuse.
