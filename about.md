I am a junior at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. When I'm not doing
schoolwork, I can be found at the boxing gym, trying new restaurants, or
playing music.

This summer, I am interning at Qualtrics, an online survey company. Previously,
I have worked at the start ups Nacho Cove, Aisle Planner, and Nukona; I did
a 9-month stint at Symantec after they acquired Nukona.

The fields in computer science that interest me most are programming languages,
specifically type systems and functional programming, and machine learning.
I would like to work somewhere that I can apply those interests.

This year, I built an iOS game called Sudz, which you can find on the App Store
[here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sudz/id938194736?mt=8). I have also
worked on a few side projects recently, including [writing a shell in
Haskell](https://github.com/dblarons/haskell-shell), building a [simple game
with a machine learning AI enemy in
Clojure](https://github.com/bad-intel/attrition), and publishing a [site map
generator in Python](https://github.com/dblarons/sitemapserpent). I am
currently working on a [BitTorrent client in
Haskell](https://github.com/dblarons/torrskel).
