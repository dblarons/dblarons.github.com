title: About

I am a second year undergraduate student at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. When I'm not doing schoolwork, I can be found at the boxing gym, trying new restaurants, or playing music.

Before I enrolled at Vanderbilt, I attended La Costa Canyon High School about 30 minutes north of San Diego. I love burritos, sunny weather, and the beach. 

I love exploring programming languages and tools. Some of my current muses include Vim, Haskell, Clojure, and tmux. I'm always looking to learn about topics I haven't yet explored.

Thanks for reading. If you want to get in touch with me, email me at <a href="mailto:aaronsmith.dev@gmail.com">aaronsmith.dev@gmail.com</a>.
